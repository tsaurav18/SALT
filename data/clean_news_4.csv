"By Shu Zhang and Bobby YipSANYA, China (Reuters) - China's Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656) on Saturday launched its Atlantis Sanya luxury resort in a $1.74 billion bet that the sail-shaped development will become an icon in Hainan - China's Hawaii - and a beacon to both domestic and foreign tourists. The conglomerate's 11 billion yuan ($1.74 billion) investment in China's southernmost province is in line with the central government's desire to further boost tourism in Hainan, already popular among Chinese holidaymakers.Fosun, co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, has been one of the country's most acquisitive overseas dealmakers.But like peers including Dalian Wanda Group and HNA Group, Fosun - China's largest privately held conglomerate - has faced increased scrutiny by Beijing for debt-fuelled, big-ticket foreign deals and is now pursuing a development path more closely aligned with Beijing's priorities.Tourism is viewed as key to China's shift towards a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one. Beijing aims to raise the country's tourism market revenue to 7 trillion yuan by 2020, from 5.3 trillion yuan last year.Hainan, one of China's top holiday destinations, has sought to internationalise its tourism sector since 2010 after winning approval from the central government to develop international tourism. But only 1.1 million out of 67 million visitors came from abroad in 2017.Located on Haitang Bay, one of the major bays in Sanya and known for its 22-kilometre strip of white, sandy beaches, Atlantis Sanya was inspired by Dubai's Atlantis, The Palm. The integrated resort offers hotel suites with views of underwater marine life, as well as a water park and a shopping mall.The resort, owned by Fosun and managed by Kerzner International [KZL.UL], occupies an area of 540,000 square metres - equal to 66 soccer pitches - and has 1,314 guest rooms. ""Atlantis Sanya is not only a forerunner of the supply-side reform of the tourism industry, but is also becoming a new landmark of Hainan tourism,"" Xu Zhenling, vice mayor of Sanya said at a news conference on Saturday ahead of the resort's grand opening scheduled for the evening.She said the resort will also raise Hainan's profile overseas, as the island province - China's largest economic development zone - seeks to further open up its economy and focus on developing modern tourism, services and high-technology industries.Plans to build China's first Atlantis resort in Hainan, the third in the world, were first unveiled in 2013.The resort adds to a broad portfolio owned by Fosun Tourism and Culture Group, a key profit growth driver for the conglomerate, which also owns the French Club Med holiday company and a stake in Canadian theatrical production company Cirque du Soleil.($1 = 6.3325 Chinese yuan renminbi) "
"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shareholders of Dutch bank ING on Tuesday voted against a motion granting executives discharge from legal liability for 2018, the company said, in a rare rebuke for the $900 million fine the company incurred in September for failing to prevent money laundering.The largely symbolic vote means the company could, theoretically, seek to hold managers legally responsible for damages, though such action is unlikely.Institutional investors including the country's two largest pension fund managers APG and PGGM, plus small shareholders' association VEB, voted against the motion.ING has said the investigation and fine, which did not have a major impact on its share price, were properly disclosed.The company said on Tuesday that other motions at the annual meeting had been approved by shareholders.

"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of AFC Ajax NV (AS:AJAX) rose the most in two years after the Dutch soccer club’s stunning UEFA Champions League victory over Real Madrid in the Spanish capital.Madrid, winners of European soccer’s elite competition for the last three seasons, were firm favorites with bookmakers to progress to the quarter finals after winning the first leg in Amsterdam 2-1 on Feb. 13. But two Ajax goals within the first 18 minutes on Tuesday night left Los Blancos, the world’s richest soccer club, chasing the tie.Dusan Tadic’s goal in the sixty-second minute meant the game’s richest team was all but out of the tournament, and the match finished 4-1 to Ajax, or 5-3 on aggregate. Ajax have won the tournament previously known as the European Cup four times, but the last victory was in 1995. The club hasn’t reached the quarter final since 2003.Ajax’s shares jumped 9.5 percent to 16.80 euros at 9:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 307.1 million euros ($347.2 million). The intraday advance of 11 percent was the biggest since March 2017.A place in the next round is worth an extra 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) in prize money, with another 31 million euros potentially at stake if clubs progress further. Success in the tournament also tends to bring greater leverage with sponsors."

"By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, weighed down by lingering uncertainty over the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China and declines in energy and industrial shares.President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States and China and earlier said there was no deal yet with China on ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063). Trump floated a plan to fine ZTE and shake up its management after his administration considering rolling back more severe penalties imposed for violating U.S. sanctions by shipping goods to Iran.Trump also said there was a ""substantial chance"" his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12.The president's comments come after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the two countries had put the prospect of a trade war ""on hold"" and agreed to hold more talks to boost U.S. exports to China.""As day worn on, Trump's comments about North Korea and not having a deal with ZTE just brought people back from yesterday's euphoria into more of a reality that this issue with trade is not going to end as quickly as many had thought,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.""So you're seeing a little bit of giveback,"" he said.The industrial sector (SPLRCI) dipped 1.3 percent, a day after posting its best percentage gain in nearly two months on the trade truce, while the energy index (SPNY) also fell 1.3 percent.Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares fell 3.3 percent, sending the stock to its lowest close since early April, a day after Consumer Reports said the company's new Model 3 car, despite many positives, had ""big flaws,"" highlighting issues with braking. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk late on Monday tweeted that the braking flaw can be fixed with a software update, and Consumer Reports said it would retest the brakes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 178.88 points, or 0.72 percent, at 24,834.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 8.57 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,724.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 15.58 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,378.46.Shares of Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) climbed 6.4 percent after the memory-chip maker announced a $10 billion stock-buyback plan.The financials sector (SPSY) rose 0.6 percent on hopes that a bill aimed at easing bank rules, put in place after the financial crisis, could be passed as soon as this week.The consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) fell 0.5 percent after warnings from retailer Kohl's and auto parts seller Autozone.Kohl's (N:KSS) tumbled 7.4 percent, weighing on other retailers, after forecasting slower growth in the second half of the year.Autozone (N:AZO) sank 9.5 percent after warning that higher costs would persist due to wage pressure.Steel stocks climbed after the United States said it would slap steep import duties on steel products with origins in China but shipped from Vietnam to evade anti-dumping orders.Carmakers Ford (N:F), General Motors (N:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (N:FCAU) gained slightly after Beijing announced tariff cuts on car imports.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 146 new highs and 36 new lows.

"(Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc's Chief Financial Officer Nancy Walsh is leaving after a year in the job at the struggling home furnishing retailer, which reported a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter on Wednesday.The company known for its wicker chairs and scented candles has been battling falling sales in the face of increasing competition from rivals such as Williams-Sonoma and online giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Walsh is the second top executive to leave the company in the last five months. Chief Executive Officer Alasdair James stepped down in December after his turnaround efforts failed to deliver results. The company had then said it was evaluating strategic options, but may not result in a sale.The company named director of consulting firm AlixPartners Deborah Rieger-Paganis as interim CFO and said it was considering closing up to 45 locations in fiscal 2020 due to lease expirations. It has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada. Pier 1 said the number of stores likely to be closed could increase by up to 15 percent if Pier 1 fails to achieve performance goals, sales targets, and reductions in occupancy and costs.Last month, Reuters reported the company has tapped debt restructuring lawyers to navigate potential negotiations with lenders.Pier 1, which has a market capitalization of about $55 million, had a long-term debt of $245.6 million as of March 2.The company on Wednesday also unveiled a plan to cut costs and save as much as $110 million in fiscal 2020 ""by resetting its gross margin and cost structure."" In the crucial holiday quarter, Pier 1 reported a 13.7 percent decline in same-store sales and missed Wall Street expectation for quarterly revenue as fewer customers visited its stores.""Our fourth-quarter sales and profitability were disappointing and reflect the execution issues we identified earlier in the year and have been working with urgency to correct,"" Cheryl Bachelder interim CEO said in a statement.Shares of the company were down 7 percent at 60 cents in extended trading.

"By Alistair SmoutLONDON (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned on Thursday any further escalation of trade tensions would damage aerospace firms globally, including the European planemaker's U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).The United States and the EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs on planes, tractors and food in the nearly 15-year trans-Atlantic dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.""The trade tensions that we see, we believe they are lose-lose tensions,"" Faury told reporters on a visit to London. Boeing on Wednesday urged the U.S. government, which has the first crack at imposing any tariffs since its WTO process is running several months ahead of the EU's, to restrict reprisals to European aircraft to avoid harming American manufacturers. But Faury said it would be impossible to isolate the fallout from the deteriorating international trade climate, which has also led to a tariff war between the United States and China.""These tensions, and the trade situation, are not supportive to any of the players in aerospace,"" he said.""We don't think we'll be losing more than the other guys in that situation, but we think it should be resolved in one way or another that enables global businesses like aviation to continue to grow,"" Faury said.The new Airbus CEO, who stepped up from its planemaking division a month ago, repeated warnings over the impact of Britain's European Union exit, while using softer language than his predecessor Tom Enders who threatened to quit the UK.Airbus, which makes wings in Britain and employs 14,000 people across the country, is using the delay in Brexit to ""prepare for all scenarios,"" Faury said, adding that a no-deal Brexit remained on the table, even if less likely.""Things have basically not changed, and therefore they are worsening. This long-lasting lack of clarity is ... a distraction,"" he said.""The UK is really a place where we are part of the ecosystem. Our plants and our sites in the UK are very competitive. We would like this to continue, whatever happens.""  "
"Investing.com - Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the world’s largest hedge fund warned Monday that a “big shakeout” in global markets is coming as investors adjust to a faster pace of interest rate increases.In an interview published in the Financial Times, Prince, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater warned that markets are entering a new era of volatility and said last week’s market turbulence was set to continue.“There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don’t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days,” he said. “We’ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.”A rout in financial markets last week saw $4tn wiped off the value of global shares and the U.S. market entered into a correction after falling more than 10% from January’s record highs.Wall Street staged a late rally on Friday but U.S. markets still recorded their worst week in two years as fears of faster inflation and thus more aggressive interest rate increases sparked a wave of selling.“Last year equity markets had a free run. But this year we are going from central banks contemplating tightening policy to actually doing it,” Prince said. “We will have more volatility as we are entering a new macroeconomic environment.”Prince also said that he expects global growth to remain on track despite the shift in central bank policy and heightened volatility in markets.“The real economy will outperform financial economy this year, the opposite of what we've seen in recent years,” he said."

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) pilots who are members of its Irish trade union will go on strike for the first time on July 12 after the union said on Tuesday the airline had failed to meet demands over new working practices.Europe's biggest budget carrier averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by deciding to recognize trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries.Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, has so far signed agreements with pilots in Italy and Britain, two of its largest markets, but also experienced minor disruption in Germany and Portugal.Ryanair pilots eligible to vote in a ballot called by the Forsa/IALPA trade union, which does not include contractors, backed the call to engage in industrial action and will strike for 24 hours next week.The union, which said 94 of the 95 ballots returned were in favor of industrial action, has advised Ryanair that it will notify it of additional strike days in due course but also remains available and willing to engage on the issues.A spokesman for Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.While Ryanair has also had success in Britain and Italy signing recognition agreements with cabin crew, some of its crew will gather in Dublin on Wednesday to demand better conditions in their first pan-European summit.At the same time, it faces the threat of strike action in Germany where pilots have until the end of July to vote on whether to stage further walkouts. Their union will continue negotiations in the mealtime, it said on Monday.Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned investors in May that he could not rule out the possibility of strikes and would face any action down.Share in the airline, which are down 21 percent from an all-time high last August before it had to cancel 20,000 flights over a rostering fiasco, triggering the pilot unrest, were 0.3 percent higher at 15.54 euros by 1450 GMT.

"Investing.com - Beyond Meat surged on Friday after delivering a narrower loss and guidance that prompted bullish calls from analysts.The vegan upstart brought in the buyers as it forecast that sales would top $210 million this year, a more than 100% increase from the $88 million seen last year. That was also above analysts' estimates for about $205 million.Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 35%.The rosier outlook was accompanied by sizzling first-quarter results, drawing a bullish call from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Bank of America raised its price target on the stock to $101 from $85. It currently has a neutral rating on the stock.The company reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of 14 cents a share, a penny narrower than the 15 cents a share analysts were expecting, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.The company has rode on the coattails of a surge in demand for plant-based foods, particular among the millennials and Gen Zers.Americans in Gen Z -- an age group that ranges roughly from 7 to 22 -- are more than twice as likely to classify themselves as vegetarians, vegans or pescatarians than their Gen X or Boomer parents, according to a survey by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult.With demand more likely to swing higher, some have raised questions about possible supply shortages.But Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown, in a call with analysts, said that the company had learned from product shortages in 2017 and 2018. He added that Beyond Meat now had the capacity to take on the big ticket of a large, national fast-food client."
"By John Benny and Liz Hampton(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) scraped past first-quarter profit estimates on Friday as higher costs weighed on a strong performance in its North America business.The oil industry has benefited from a 7.5 percent rise in U.S crude oil prices (CLc1) in the first quarter as a strengthening global economy and OPEC-led supply cut reduced excess global supplies.Shares of Schlumberger, considered a bellwether for the oilfield services and drilling industries, were down 1.3 percent at $69.40 in premarket trading as part of a broader decline in oil stocks and prices.Brent and U.S. crude turned negative after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized OPEC for rising prices that he said were being artificially increased and would not be accepted.Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services provider, said revenue from North America jumped nearly 52 percent to $2.84 billion.However, the company's total cost of manufacturing products and delivering services rose nearly 12 percent to $6.80 billion.Revenue from international operations, the company's biggest segment, fell 0.8 percent to $4.88 billion.Total revenue rose to $7.83 billion from $6.89 billion.Net profit attributable to Schlumberger rose to $525 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $279 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"(Reuters) - No more parties and events in homes listed on Airbnb, the short-term home rental company said on Thursday as it tries to enforce strict social-distancing norms to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.The new rules include a cap on occupancy at 16, with hosts or guests who try to skirt the rules facing a ban from Airbnb's community and even legal action, the company said on Thursday. ""Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,"" Airbnb said in a statement, adding that the ban applies to all future bookings.Airbnb said 73% of its listings globally already ban parties in their house rules, while some hosts allow small parties such as baby showers or birthday parties.Last year, Airbnb began imposing much stricter limits, starting with a global ban on ""party houses"" or listings that create persistent neighborhood nuisance.Airbnb has also updated its policies in light of the pandemic, removing both the ""event friendly"" search filter and ""parties and events allowed"" house rules.The global ban comes a day after Airbnb said it filed confidentially for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators, setting the stage for one of 2020's marquee stock market debuts.The potential IPO underscores a rebound in parts of the travel industry, which was battered this year by restrictions and shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.San Francisco-based Airbnb said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3, in part as U.S. travelers shy away from hotels and prefer to drive to local vacation rentals.

"By Philip BlenkinsopBRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Lionel Platteuw started planning how he would cope under Belgium's coronavirus lockdown, there was one item he wanted to make sure he had enough of - alcohol.""My first concern was that we didn't have enough beer and wine,"" said the Brussels-based consultant. ""I wasn't concerned about toilet paper, but I didn't want to be stuck at home without alcohol supplies.""Soaring sales of beer, wine and spirits at retail outlets suggest drinkers across the world took a similar attitude. Sales at British liquor stores leapt a third in March, while those for alcohol at U.S. retailers shot up more than 50% in the week after the country entered a state of national emergency.But the drinks industry isn't popping any corks.The surge in demand came as sales through bars, clubs and restaurants fell to zero as they were closed to contain the virus. And even as countries start to ease restrictions, these venues are likely to be at the back of the line to reopen. Manufacturers have also faced supply disruptions and, in some countries, even a ban on sales as authorities worry excessive drinking could jeopardise social distancing efforts. A deep global economic downturn also looks set to hit consumer spending, with signs drinkers are switching from premium brands to cheaper alternatives and multipacks.NO SOCIAL OCCASIONSIn the United States, ""on-trade"" drinking at bars and restaurants accounts for about 20% of spirits sales and 25% for beer, so off-premise drinking would need to keep growing by 25-30% to compensate.The signs are it's already starting to slow.While U.S. stores' alcohol sales are up a quarter since early March, the rate of growth slowed to 16% in the week to April 18, according to market research firm Nielsen. In Europe, bars generally account for a bigger proportion of alcohol sales, rising to 60% in Spain. In many developing countries, including China and Brazil and for beer in Nigeria and Ethiopia, at least half of drinking is in bars.Cees 't Hart, the chief executive of Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb), told Reuters that in Europe retail sales had already returned to normal after initial panic buying.Dutch rival  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) noted that even store-bought alcohol was often designed for group events now barred in most countries. ""Beer belongs to social occasions and these occasions for consumption are simply lost,"" Chief Executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said last month, after reporting beer volumes fell by a third in Italy and a quarter in Spain in March.SUPPLY PROBLEMS Lockdowns have created other problems for drinks makers. They have had to suspend production in countries such as China, India, Malaysia and Mexico, where there was only about 10 days of beer inventory last week.Draconian travel restrictions have also closed duty-free shops, a particular concern for spirits makers. Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the maker of Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey, has forecast an 80% decline of its ""travel retail"" business from February to June. In India, the world's largest whisky market, most alcohol shops were forced to shut in its countrywide lockdown. South Africa has banned all alcohol sales for more than a month.As restrictions start to ease, it is not clear how quickly drinkers will return to old habits. Manit Parikh, the head of an English learning technology company in Bengaluru, said he was ""gutted"" at not being able to have a drink or two in the lockdown, but also scared to go to liquor stores when they reopened with long lines on Monday.New York-based insurance industry temp Samantha Gool said she switched to more vodka from beer and her drinking increased when confined at home, although may have started to taper.Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research at Euromonitor International, believes there won't be a surge in demand as lockdowns gradually ease, with some bars going bust, social distancing limiting business and some customers wary of going out.BOXED WINE AND MULTIPACKSHe also believes the crisis could spell the end, or at least the suspension, of an industry-wide trend of the past two decades - persuading drinkers to spend more on ""premium"" brands.In the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, consumers traded down to cheaper products. And all the signs suggest the hit to jobs and economies from the coronavirus pandemic - at least in the short term - will be much bigger. Wine consumption in Europe is forecast to fall by 8% this year, with a particular hit for sparkling and vintage wines, according to the European Commission.In beer, marketing agency InMarket says AB InBev's (BR:ABI) budget Busch Light has seen the sharpest increase in sales since early March.In Europe, Carlsberg has seen consumers veer towards multi-packs, while Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize said its biggest increase in alcohol sales was boxed wine. Many smaller players, particularly once booming craft brewers, are suffering.Last year, the number of breweries in Europe passed 10,000. Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, secretary-general of the Brewers of Europe, sees the European market dropping by a third.""Some players have no channels to retail at all,"" he said. ""There will be people who will simply not survive."" "
"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Steelworkers union (USW) on Friday rejected a proposal by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc for an automatic extension of the national refinery workers' contract beyond its Feb. 1 expiration date, sources familiar with the talks said.The union also instructed local union negotiators to reject similar proposals being made at talks taking place around the United States, the sources said.The USW and Shell began negotiations on Wednesday for a new national agreement governing pay, health insurance, job security, and safety for 30,000 workers at U.S. refineries and chemical plants.A Shell spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Friday night.Royal Dutch Shell's U.S. arm, Shell Oil Co, represents the U.S. oil industry. Shell has been the lead company in oil worker contract negotiations since 1997. The proposal for an automatic extension of the contract could undermine the union's National Oil Bargaining Program, which tries to keep the national agreement and as many local contracts on the same expiration date, the sources said.These are the first negotiations for a national contract since 2015 when a stalemate led to rolling strikes that sent more than 7,000 workers off their jobs at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. The 2015 strike lasted about two months at most plants, but continued for months at some locations. The USW is seeking a three-year agreement with the oil industry that would replace the pact that expires on Feb. 1. The union's proposals include an 8 percent annual wage increase for each year of the contract. Union members with four years' experience earn about $40 an hour. "
"By Nick CareyDETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted a hefty drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for September, caused in part by a decline in sales in areas hit by Hurricane Florence and a tough comparison to the previous September when consumers rushed to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey. Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) bucked the trend for the month, reporting a 15 percent jump in U.S. sales, led by increases in sales of its lucrative Jeeps - especially its Cherokee and Compass models - and Ram pickup trucks.The solid performance put FCA's total sales ahead of longtime No. 2 U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) for the month of September.Hurricane Florence flooded large parts of North Carolina and South Carolina last month, leaving residents to deal with the deluge instead of shopping for new cars.Sales in September 2017 were boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which had flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August that year.The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales (SAAR) for September hit 18.1 million units in September 2017 - the highest sales pace since 2005.Despite the sales decline versus the same month in 2017, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the SAAR of U.S. car and light truck sales for September came in at 17.44 million vehicles - the highest sales pace since November 2017. This was above the SAAR of 16.9 million units expected by analysts.After a strong first half of the year, U.S. new auto sales are expected to dip in the second half of 2018, as rising interest rates in particular translate into higher monthly car payments and push more Americans toward buying used vehicles.U.S. consumers last month continued a longstanding trend of abandoning passenger cars for larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs.""September was a bloodbath for cars,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs told reporters on a conference call. ""They dropped like a rock.""Ford Motor Co (N:F) on Tuesday reported an 11.2 percent drop in sales, with declines in every major category. Sales of sedans were down nearly 26 percent.Ford also posted a decline of nearly 9 percent for sales of its best-selling, and highly profitable, F-Series pickup trucks and a 2.7 percent drop in sales of SUVs.In a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve referred to September as a ""tale of two hurricanes.""""Hurricane Florence was a big factor this month,"" LaNeve said, adding that post-storm recovery efforts were ""moving quickly.""General Motors Co (N:GM) said its third-quarter sales were down 11.1 percent versus the same period in 2017. Earlier this year, the No. 1 U.S. automaker stopped reporting monthly sales, arguing that a 30-day snapshot did not accurately portray market trends.Sales were down at all of GM's major brands, with particularly sharp decreases for passenger cars.""Our brands are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter when our next wave of new products start shipping in high volume,"" Kurt McNeil, GM U.S. vice president for sales, said in a news release.GM has high hopes for all-new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 10.4 percent in September. Sedan sales at the Japanese automaker were off nearly 28 percent. That included a 17 percent decline for its flagship Camry midsize sedan, which was completely redesigned with the aim of increasing market share.Toyota's SUV and pickup truck sales were down 0.3 percent for the month.Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 12.2 percent drop in sales for September, with a 35.7 percent decline in passenger car sales more than offsetting a 6.6 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.Sales of Nissan's best-selling vehicle, the Rogue crossover, fell 10.6 percent in September.""It was a tough comparison for sales year-over-year, but otherwise the month was very solid for us with some bright spots,"" said Billy Hayes, the automaker’s vice president for regional operations in North America. ""We're still extremely bullish and we're feeling very good about the rest of the year.""Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said sales were off 7 percent in September, as a 19 percent decrease in passenger cars outmatched a 6.3 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.Monthly sales of the automaker's completely revamped Accord dropped by 15 percent.Ford shares closed 1.3 percent lower at $9.20 on Tuesday. GM shares were down 2.6 percent at $33.30 and FCA shares dipped 0.6 percent to close at $17.88 in New York trading."
"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send messages to more than 200 million U.S. cellphones on Wednesday testing a previously unused presidential alert system that aims to warn the public in the event of a national emergency.The test message was originally scheduled for September but was pushed back to Wednesday at 2:18 p.m. EDT. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which will send the alert, said the messages would bear the headline “Presidential Alert,” and that phones will make a loud tone and have a special vibration.The test has been scheduled to ensure that the alert system would work in the event of a national emergency. The message will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” A separate alert on TV and radios will be issued at 2:20 p.m..The tests have drawn a lot of attention on social media in part because of President Donald Trump's propensity for sending tweets to his 55 million followers. On a conference call, government officials told reporters that Trump would not personally trigger the alert -- from his phone or any other device -- and emphasized that no president could ""wake up one morning and attempt to send a personal message.""The test alert will be sent by a device similar to a laptop from a FEMA laboratory.An actual alert would be used for an impending missile attack or other national emergency. Then-President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 requiring FEMA to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies.Federal Communications Commissioner Mike O'Rielly told reporters on Tuesday that an April 5 regional test of the emergency alert system in the Washington area showed some potential issues. He said some people did not receive alerts on some devices during that test. ""We're trying to analyze that,"" O'Rielly said.The country's wireless emergency alert system has issued over 36,000 alerts for situations such as missing children, extreme weather and natural disasters since 2012, but never a presidential directive.Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts, but not presidential alerts.  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said nearly all of its mobile phone handsets are capable of getting alerts.Government officials estimated that the alert would reach upwards of 225 million U.S. cellphones, or around 75 percent of all phones. They said a person on a call lasting 30 minutes may not get the alert as with phones with an active data connection. "
"By Maiya Keidan and Kirstin RidleyLONDON (Reuters) - As the hedge funds once clustered in London's Mayfair negotiate gyrating markets, they are facing a new line of investor questioning: who has contracted COVID-19?With billions sometimes riding on the performance of one star manager, or a small constellation of talent, investor interest in delving into the medical status of staff -- a realm considered by many private -- is perhaps understandable during a pandemic.""The important thing for managers is planning – what do they intend to do on the basis of when, not if, they get the virus,"" said one of three investors who told Reuters they wanted to be informed about any coronavirus infections at the hedge funds they invest with.But most of Britain's hedge fund managers have no protocol for divulging such details and there are no specific legal requirements for them to do so, according to Samuel Brooks, a partner at law firm Macfarlanes.As many infected by the novel coronavirus appear to show only mild symptoms, some hedge funds – normally based in the well-heeled west London enclave but now scattered and working from home – are taking a ‘need to know’ approach to staff health disclosures.They say they would only tell investors if their top managers fell seriously ill, but not necessarily inform them of a mild infection, or if lower-ranking staff became sick, according to interviews.""You have a duty to your investors to advise them should any of your key employees or senior management fall ill with anything that incapacitates them beyond a reasonable period of time,"" said Kristofer Tremaine, founder and CIO at trade finance hedge fund Kimura Capital.""Admission to hospital with COVID-19 would fall into that category.""James Sivyer, an analyst at hedge fund data and analysis firm HFM, said the consensus view among 25 hedge funds was that the disease was now so widespread that a mild case would almost be a non-event -- and none he had spoken with had notified or planned to notify end investors about such infections.Regulated British finance firms are obliged to report any material issues impacting their businesses and have to pay ""due regard"" to the interests of their customers under Financial Conduct Authority rules.Where funds can be managed by a variety of people, and are advertised as such, their obligation to notify investors about staff absences depends in part on their prospectus, succession plans and any individual agreements with investors, regulatory experts say.""We sometimes see investment managers being required to provide this type of information because of how they have described the portfolio being run in their prospectus,"" said Devarshi Saksena, partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons.The risks of having so many assets tied to the performance of one person or a small group of people -- known as 'key person risk' -- has long been an issue in the hedge fund industry, where a star manager can attract billions from investors.Big, influential and early investors may manage such risks with additional agreements called side letters, that can allow for greater transparency, although some regulators have raised concerns about their use.Nevertheless, some hedge funds are adamant that things would need to get critical before they divulge staff medical details. One portfolio manager, who declined to be named, said he would have to be at death's door before investors were informed.""If I were going to die from it then, yes, we would tell our investors,"" he said.

"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Can this rally be trusted?Europe’s stock markets had time on their hands to consider that question early Friday, as traders were content to stay on the sidelines ahead of the all-important U.S. labor market report for August at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).By 5 AM, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was largely unchanged at 385.98 but still on course for a weekly gain of nearly 2% after Thursday’s rally. It’s now made good nearly all the losses incurred since President Donald Trump’s fateful tweet at the start of August which triggered a round of tit-for-tat escalations of the trade war.By the same token, the German DAX was up 0.1%, also at its highest since early August, while the FTSE 100 was unchanged.Luxury names outperformed on more signs of a potential de-escalation of the protest in Hong Kong, which accounts for a disproportional amount of sales and profit at groups such as Burberry and Gucci owner Kering.Elsewhere, all was becalmed, with another set of gloomy German industrial production data keeping any optimism firmly in check. With incoming orders to German factories also falling in July, the first “hard” data of the third quarter from Europe’s largest economy have pointed clearly to a second straight quarter of contraction in the summer.“Since reunification there have been four comparable industrial setbacks of which three ended in a recession,” Allianz economist Katharina Utermoehl said via Twitter. However, she pointed to one key difference with the last recession in 2008/9, which is that the addition of 6 million jobs to the German economy in the last decade has left consumption structurally stronger.With no turnaround in sight in the euro zone economy (second-quarter GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2% on Friday), much is now resting on the outcome of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting next week.“Even if (the German data) come too late to be incorporated into next week’s official ECB forecasts, it will be another argument for ECB members in favor of new monetary stimulus,” said Carsten Brzeski.Most analysts expect the ECB to cut its discount rate by 0.1% or 0.2%, and to adjust the price of its new long-term loans to as to keep short-term interest rates anchored lower. The big open question is whether it will renew its purchases of bonds, given that a vocal minority of central bankers from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have all voiced resistance to the idea in the last week."

"(Bloomberg) -- Baker Hughes, the Houston-based oilfield services business, agreed to buy a 5 percent stake in Adnoc Drilling, a deal that values the unit of government-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. at about $11 billion.The investment marks the first time that an international partner takes a direct equity stake in an existing Adnoc services business, the companies said Monday in a joint statement. The valuation of Adnoc Drilling includes about $1 billion of net debt.Baker Hughes, a GE company, will provide specialized equipment and technologies to Adnoc Drilling, which supplies oil rigs to other Adnoc businesses and is the Middle East’s largest drilling company, they said. The agreement may help Adnoc Drilling expand outside the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC producer in which the emirate of Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil, the companies said.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking to boost supply to offset a decline in oil exports from Iran, due to U.S. sanctions, and plummeting production in Venezuela. The increase has yet to significantly reduce prices, with Brent crude 25 percent higher this year.Faster DrillingThe partnership with Baker Hughes “comes at an important time in the drilling needs of Abu Dhabi as Adnoc grows its conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources and as we see future potential for further regional growth,” Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said.Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said the deal will help “drive predictable revenue streams and long-term growth for both companies and lets us invest in a stable, reliable and secure market environment.”The partnership aims to help Adnoc boost its conventional drilling activity by 40 percent by 2025, increase the number of its unconventional wells and reach its target of reducing drilling time by 30 percent by the end of 2019, according to the statement. Having a single company provide all necessary services will prove “transformative” for Adnoc, said Robin Mills, chief executive officer of Dubai-based consultant Qamar Energy.“We needed to get away from operating in different silos, from different contractors working the well,” Abdul Munim Al Kindy, director of Adnoc upstream and chairman of Adnoc Drilling, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. The agreement with Baker Hughes “is about removing the interfaces between different services that go to complete a well and integrate it all in one company,” he said.The deal will close in the fourth quarter, upon regulatory approval, and Baker Hughes will hold a seat on Adnoc Drilling’s board of directors, the companies said.Moelis & Co. is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Adnoc in the transaction, while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is advising Baker Hughes.(Updates with analyst in seventh paragraph; Adnoc Drilling chairman in eighth.)"

"(Bloomberg) -- As the U.K. mulls further action against Russia in response to a nerve agent attack on a former spy on British soil, the question of whether policymakers should go after the bond market is back on the table.Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure from some U.K. lawmakers to look into Russia’s sovereign debt. The issue is “extremely important” and officials are monitoring the matter very closely, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.But like their U.S. colleagues before them, U.K. policymakers may find this isn’t a path they’re prepared, or able, to go down.

But neither is incorporated in the U.K., so Theresa May would need approval from her European counterparts for an EU-wide ban.“The U.K. cannot force Euroclear or Clearstream to refuse the clearing of Russian bonds,” said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. “It can try to impose EU sanctions on the Russian sovereign debt, which would have this effect, but I see this as unlikely at the moment.”When, in 2016, Russia sold its first Eurobond since sanctions were imposed on individuals and industries over the Crimea crisis, Belgium-based Euroclear SA didn’t initially agree to handle it. Clearstream International SA hasn’t processed new Russian debt sales since 2013. The 2016 sale went ahead anyway and most foreign investors bought the bond when Euroclear accepted it two months later. Both clearing houses declined to comment on whether they would respond to pressure from the U.K. government over Russia.Dependency Goes Both WaysImposing restrictions on Russian sovereign debt markets would push down prices of the country’s outstanding bonds. Since many of those assets are owned by international investors, including British pension funds, the U.K. would be shooting itself in the foot through its penalties. Investec Plc, Legal & General Group (LON:LGEN) Plc and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc are British money managers listed among the biggest holders of Russian Eurobonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Russia Can Survive Without DebtIn some respects, the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals in 2014 showed that Russia can always muddle through on its own. Those restrictions forced the country to cut down on borrowing (albeit at the expense of economic growth), giving it a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 14 percent, one of the lowest in the world. Thanks to higher oil prices, the Finance Ministry may add about $35 billion to its rainy-day fund this year.If Russia’s sovereign debt is sanctioned, the Finance Ministry would simply reduce borrowing, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview with Russian TV Rain aired on Thursday.The U.S. Already Decided It’s Not Worth ItThe U.S. Treasury already looked into sanctioning Russian debt markets in response to alleged interference in the 2016 elections. Their conclusion: it would be too damaging for global markets. Their report on the subject published in February concluded that preventing American investors from buying Russian sovereign debt would hinder the competitiveness of asset managers.“Because Russia’s economy has extensive real- and financial-sector linkages to global businesses and investors, the effects of the sanctions would not be limited to Russian authorities and business,” the report concluded."
"By Tina BellonNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday denied a request by an Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc customer to overturn an arbitration win for the company in a price-fixing case over claims the arbitrator only ruled in Uber's favor because he was scared.U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said the claim was without merit, with the arbitrator, Les Weinstein, simply joking when he said he dismissed the lawsuit in February and said he acted out of fear.""After carefully reviewing the full record, the court finds that the arbitrator's concluding remarks, rather than a sincere confession of fear, were simply an attempt at humor - one of many made by the arbitrator throughout the hearing,"" Rakoff wrote on Monday. Spencer Meyer initiated the high-profile 2015 antitrust lawsuit alleging Uber engaged in an illegal conspiracy with its drivers to coordinate high ""surge pricing"" fares during periods of heavy demand by agreeing to charge prices set by an algorithm in the Uber ride-hailing app.The lawsuit sought a nationwide ban against surge pricing. A ruling against the company would have threatened Uber's business, which takes a cut from drivers' earnings.The company argues its drivers are independent contractors and that its app is merely a technology platform connecting drivers with passengers. After going through several courts, the lawsuit was sent into arbitration in 2019 in accordance with Uber's terms of service. Weinstein, the arbitrator, dismissed Spencer's lawsuit on Feb. 22. According to court transcripts, he concluded his ruling by saying: ""I must say I act out of fear. My fear is if I ruled Uber illegal, I would need security. I wouldn't be able to walk the streets at night. People would be after me.""Spencer in May asked Rakoff to overturn the ruling, arguing Weinstein had displayed ""evident partiality."" "
"By Siddharth Cavale(Reuters) - Shares in  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB) rose on Friday after the U.S. health regulator exempted menthol and tobacco from a list of popular e-cigarette flavors that it has banned under new guidelines.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said e-cigarette makers will be banned from selling pod-based e-cigarette flavors, including fruit, dessert and mint, in the United States from February. The ban was less stringent than one U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed in September, when he threatened to remove all flavors, including menthol, from all types of e-cigarettes to curb a teenage vaping epidemic.BAT shares rose as much as 2.5% and were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) where many shares were hit by heightened tensions in the Middle East.Imperial Brands was also among the handful of gainers, with its shares up 1.4%. Fears of an outright ban led BAT and Imperial to lower their growth forecasts for their U.S. vaping businesses last year. ""Following a significant period of disruption and uncertainty, this regulatory clarity is a welcome step towards returning the U.S. vapor market to stability,"" BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Vuse e-cigarettes, said on Friday.The new FDA guidelines would also allow tobacco makers to bring back some of the banned flavors if their marketing applications passed a substantive review by the FDA.This removed some ambiguity related to the future of the exempted products, Simon Evans, spokesman for Imperial Brands said. ""In addition to exempting menthol, the FDA guidance is clear that flavored products will return to the market once they have been approved through the Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) process,"" he said. Brokerage Jefferies said that while vaping sales would take a near-term hit from the new rules, the overall financial impact for BAT and Imperial would be minimal as most users would either switch to menthol or tobacco, or even to higher-margin traditional tobacco products.""We are actually bullish on implications of this final guidance,"" Jefferies said. BAT submitted a marketing application for its Vuse Solo e-cigarette to the FDA in November, while Imperial said it would submit its applications for its Blu e-cigarettes before May.  "

"By David RandallNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled slightly more than $5 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, ending what had been the largest rush into domestic stocks since 2016, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.The retreat from the U.S. stock market came after investors had pushed $17.9 billion into funds that hold domestic stocks over the two previous weeks, and was the first move away from U.S. stocks since the $8.2 billion decline in net assets during the week that ended June 5.Investors have pulled a total of $35.6 billion out of U.S. stock funds since the start of the year despite a rally that has pushed the S&P 500 up more than 19% to new record highs. The move has been fueled largely by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, making equities more attractive by lowering company and consumer borrowing costs.Bond funds continued to rake in new assets despite the prospect of lower interest rates. Taxable and municipal debt funds brought in slightly more than $10.5 billion in new assets, continuing a streak in which the category has pulled in $213.4 billion since the beginning of the year.World stocks, meanwhile, lost $3.4 billion in net outflows, leaving the category down nearly $13.1 billion for the year to date."

"By Alexandria SageSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Thursday it would not be profitable in the first quarter, as it offered for the first time a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only, steps designed to increase demand and cut overhead costs for the electric vehicle maker.Chief Executive Elon Musk's warning on profit during a conference call with members of the media, which did not include Reuters, contrasted with Tesla's statements last month that it was expecting a ""very small"" net profit in the first quarter. Shares of Tesla fell 3.4 percent after hours. Investors have voiced concerns about whether Tesla would be able to maintain profit margins through cost cutting - such as recent layoffs - as it reduces prices of its newest vehicle.Still, the price drop could quell concerns from some analysts that demand for the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 was beginning to dry up in the United States, especially after a federal tax credit was cut in half this year.""Tesla wants to drum up demand,"" said Elazar Advisors' Chaim Siegel. ""There was a slowdown in the U.S. as the tax credits dropped. (There are) more tax credit hits later in the year too so they are trying to be proactive.""Musk has often shared that his strategy for Tesla was to build higher-priced cars - the Model S and X - whose success would ultimately usher in a $35,000 mass-market car, followed by an SUV, the Model Y, which is currently in development. But customers who reserved the Model 3 at that lower price have waited nearly three years since Musk first promised it. An online-only sales strategy, along with other changes, would allow vehicle prices to fall by about 6 percent on average, Tesla said in a blog on its website https:// Over the next few months, Tesla will wind down ""many"" of its stores, while investing in its service system, it said.Online-only sales represent a dramatic shift for the company that has prided itself on its boutique retail stores. In June 2017, Musk pledged to increase the number of stores, saying they had ""barely touched the surface"" of what was possible. As of the fourth quarter, Tesla said it recently opened 27 new locations, bringing its total of stores and service centers to 378. Thursday was the third time this year that Tesla lowered the price on the Model 3, which recently started at $42,900. The new $35,000 version has a top speed of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) and can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, Tesla said. For $2,000 more, Tesla offers a version with a range of 240 miles (386 km) and a top speed of 140 mph.GAME CHANGER WITH SPEED BUMPS A $35,000 Model 3 is a major shot in the arm for Tesla sales during a period of major challenges, including deliveries of the Model 3 to Europe and China and construction of a factory in Shanghai.""This is a game changer,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Since tax credits will continue to decline over 2019, ""this is really exactly what the doctor ordered,"" he said.He warned, however, there could be ""more speed bumps ahead,"" if more sales volume exacerbates prior problems with deliveries and service to customers. Musk declined to answer a question on what the profit margins of the $35,000 vehicle would be, according to the New York Times. Gross margins on the car were above 20 percent in the fourth quarter. ""The margin on the vehicle obviously is going to be very small if there's any margin there at all,"" said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which has a short position in Tesla.As part of cost-cutting efforts, Tesla last month reduced its full-time headcount by 7 percent, following a similar cut of 9 percent to its workforce in June 2018.The price cut on the Model 3 comes three days after renewed tensions between Musk and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency petitioned a judge this week to have Tesla's CEO found in contempt of an October settlement between the parties. The SEC accuses Musk of having made material statements about production levels on Twitter without first having them vetted internally. That settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC concerned Musk's August Twitter post in which he claimed to have ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. On Friday, Tesla is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $40 below the $359.87 conversion price. Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December. "

"By Claire MilhenchLONDON (Reuters) - British investors increased their equity exposure in August from July's nine-month lows, favoring emerging markets after a shake-out in the sector, but cut UK assets as the risk of a no-deal Brexit grew.Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 17 UK-based asset managers was conducted Aug. 16-28 as world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) climbed to a six-month high. U.S. equities (SPX) (IXIC) also set record highs after a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) raised hopes that a global trade war could be averted.Most participants completed the poll before the accord was announced, but the mood was still more bullish than it had been in July when trade war concern sapped investor confidence.""The global economy remains in a period of synchronized economic growth and despite some weakness in the eurozone, continues to gather momentum,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust.In the poll, British managers raised their global equity exposure to 51.2 percent from 50.4 percent in July. They cut cash by 1.6 percentage points to 4.4 percent, the lowest level in at least five years. Mark Shields, investment director for the multi-asset team at Brooks Macdonald, was among those overweighting risk assets: ""Premiums in valuations in the U.S. are warranted in our view given the strong consumer backdrop, earnings momentum and the pace of economic expansion,"" he said.The U.S. stocks allocation held at last month's 34 percent, the highest in nearly two years. Investors also ramped up their exposure to emerging-market stocks to 18.4 percent from July's 16.3 percent, after a turbulent month.Emerging-market equities (MSCIEF) are down over 9 percent year-to-date, clobbered by trade war fears and rising U.S. interest rates. Emerging-market currencies sold off again in August as crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified and rising U.S. sanctions risk hit Russia.The lira  is now down over 40 percent year-to-date, crushed by Turkey's loose monetary and fiscal policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. But poll participants who answered a question on the currency's travails were split over whether the lira had troughed. Forty-one 41 percent said it hadn't, a third said it had, and a quarter were undecided.TIME TO BUYThere was more agreement over whether it was time to buy emerging-market assets. Two-thirds of those who answered that question agreed. Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth, noted the assets looked cheap compared with developed- market debt and equities. ""The recent sell-off represents an attractive new entry level,"" he said, arguing that fears of contagion from Argentina, Brazil and Turkey to other markets was unjustified. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, also saw more positives than negatives for emerging markets in coming months. He acknowledged risks in Turkey, Venezuela and Brazil but added: ""We have seen strong profits growth for the EM complex, and better valuations encourage us to look for buying opportunities.""UK assets were shunned, with sterling hitting a one-year low versus the euro in August as fears over a no-deal Brexit grew.Investors slashed their UK equity exposure by 3.6 percentage points to 21.2 percent, the lowest level since April 2015. UK bond holdings also fell to 21.5 percent, the lowest since May.""With Brexit moving ever closer and uncertainty remaining, many UK investors have moved to the side of caution,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum, noting that overseas investors also appeared to be shying away from the UK.

"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it was putting 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision (SZ:002415) - on a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.Those added to the so-called ""Entity List"" include the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region People’s Government Public Security Bureau, 19 subordinate government agencies and eight commercial firms, according to a Commerce Department filing. The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology (SZ:002236), IFLYTEK Co (SZ:002230),  Xiamen Meiya Pico Information  Co (SZ:300188) and Yixin Science and Technology Co.Reuters reported on the planned additions earlier Monday, before the Commerce Department made it official.The department filing said the ""entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.""U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to this week's resumption of trade talks with China. Being added to the ""Entity List"" bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.The Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List.Hikvision, officially known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world’s largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.Hikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department's move.John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia, Ambarella,  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagates as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be “devastating."" Shares in Ambarella fell more than 9% on the news.In August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government's restrictions."

"By Anna IrreraNEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) have invested $17.5 million in AccessFintech, a startup that sells technology to help financial firms better handle business errors, the companies said on Thursday.Israel-based AccessFintech has created a network that aggregates and helps resolve so-called business ""exceptions"", or errors that financial institutions make when carrying out business activities and that require interventions to be resolved. In capital markets, these errors may include data discrepancies between counterparties on the financial terms of a trade or wrong information used to identify a client. Once spotted the errors are normally handled manually, via numerous phone calls and emails between various firms.AccessFintech's technology will help reduce the time and resources needed to resolve these issues by helping financial institutions communicate with each other. It will also reduce the risks associated with the errors. Large banks have become more open to collaborating with each other and with young financial technology startups on areas that do not give them an edge over rivals. ""We see a dramatic level of difference as to what banks are willing to collaborate on, or outsource to shared vendors instead of building internally,"" Roy Saadon, founder and chief executive of AccessFintech, said in an interview. ""We see the banks in a search for efficiency in the places where things are not competitive."" Saadon was one of the co-founders of market infrastructure provider Traiana. All four banks have been working with AccessFintech over the past year, individually and as a group, the companies said. AccessFintech's customers also include asset managers, custodians and fund administrators. ""Once we understood the impact on the operational model of the financial participants it was a quick decision to provide the financial backing,"" Ana Capella, head of strategic investments at JPMorgan, said in a statement. AccessFintech, which also has offices in London and other financial centers, will use the funding to grow its business, accelerating efforts including in sales and client coverage, Saadon said.  "

"By Nate Raymond(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, facing a wave of lawsuits blaming it for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, said on Wednesday it had laid off about 350 employees this week including the remainder of its already-downsized sales force.The Stamford, Connecticut-based pharmaceutical manufacturer said about half of the affected employees were part of its sales force, which had already seen cuts announced in February when Purdue said it would stop promoting opioids to physicians.At the time, Purdue said its remaining 200 sales representatives would focus on promoting on non-opioid products. The layoffs, adding to 380 employees who left the company earlier this year, will leave Purdue with about 550 employees as the company says it is shifting to focus on pursuing new drugs. ""Purdue Pharma is taking significant steps to transform and diversify beyond our historic focus of pain medications,"" Purdue said in a statement. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Privately-held Purdue and other opioid manufacturers have been fighting hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities accusing the companies of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. The lawsuits have generally accused Purdue of deceiving doctors and patients by misrepresenting the risks of addiction and death associated with the prolonged use of its prescription opioids. The company denies the allegations.While Purdue has engaged in settlement talks with a group of state attorneys general conducting an investigation into it and other opioid manufacturers, a growing number of states have chosen to instead take the company to court.In total, Purdue faces lawsuits by 24 states and the territory of Puerto Rico.Most recently, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on June 12 sued Purdue and 16 current or former Purdue executives and board members, including members of the wealthy Sackler family, which owns the company.Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties.Sales of OxyContin have been declining in recent years. OxyContin generated $1.74 billion in sales in 2017, down from $2.6 billion five years earlier, according to data compiled by Symphony Health Solutions.Purdue continues to sell opioids. It has been directing doctors with opioid-related questions to its medical affairs department.(This version of the story corrects spelling of Stamford in second paragraph) "

"(Bloomberg) -- New-home sales in the U.S. jumped to the highest level in almost 14 years in July as low mortgage rates helped fuel a suburban construction boom.Purchases of new single-family houses climbed 13.9% from June to a 901,000 annualized pace from an upwardly revised 791,000, government data showed Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 790,000 rate of sales. The median selling price rose 7.2% from a year earlier to $330,600.Sales of new houses have taken off during the pandemic because borrowing costs have never been lower and listings for previously owned homes are in short supply. Shoppers want quarantine comforts, such as backyards and room for offices. And builders are shifting to lower-priced offerings, expanding the pool of potential buyers.“It has been a rocket ship up since May,” said Rick Palacios, director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which advises builders. “Demand is insatiable right now.”The market is so strong that builders are having to raise prices to slow down the pace of sales and ensure they won’t blow through inventory, Palacios said. About 70% of builders surveyed by John Burns Real Estate last month said they increased prices, compared with just 27% in the previous July.Three out of four major U.S. regions showed higher sales of new homes in July. Purchases surged 58.8% in the Midwest, climbed 13% in the South and 7.8% in the West. Sales fell 23.1% in the Northeast.The supply of new homes at the current sales pace was four months.An S&P index of homebuilder shares, which had rallied 30% this year, fell 0.8% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, maintaining earlier declines.(Updates with regional performance in sixth paragraph.)©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
"(Reuters) - The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday Viagogo had addressed its outstanding concerns about how the ticket reseller presents important information to its customers, prompting the watchdog to suspend preparations for court action.Viagogo and the CMA have been in court on the issue of the use of ""hover text"" to display the face value of tickets and the deadlines for people to claim for refunds. Hover text is when users place their cursor over certain text to get additional information on a website.CMA had also stated that the company was selling tickets with resale restrictions, misleading on availability of tickets and non-disclosure of certain seat numbers.The watchdog had said in July that it would take further legal action against the company for contempt of court following concerns that it had failed to comply fully with an earlier court order.""Viagogo has now addressed the UK competition authority's outstanding concerns about how it presents information,"" the CMA said on Thursday.It added that a further independent review of Viagogo's compliance with the court order will be completed in October, and if results suggests the company is not meeting its obligations then the CMA could take further action – through the courts if necessary.The secondary ticketing market, which resells tickets for events ranging from pop concerts to tennis and soccer matches, has come under fire from politicians and regulators for sometimes sky-high prices and misleading customers.""Viagogo is pleased it has been able to work with the CMA to find solutions to the final few areas of discussion ...

"By Chris GallagherFUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Sunday said it was vital that  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor strengthen their alliance as the auto industry undergoes rapid change in the areas of electric and connected vehicles.Speaking after a meeting of G20 finance ministers in the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, Le Maire noted the synergies Renault has enjoyed with its Japanese partner which could help them take the lead in 21st century technologies.""Looking at the past 20 years, we see that this quality of Renault has been reinforced by its partnership with Nissan,"" he told reporters.""Therefore it is essential not only to preserve, but to strengthen this alliance. That has always been the strategy of the state and it remains the strategy of the state as shareholder.""Le Maire said the previous day in an interview with Agence France Presse that the French government was ready to reduce its 15% stake in Renault in the interest of bolstering the automaker's alliance with Nissan Motor.That comment came just days after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) withdrew its $35 billion merger offer for Renault blaming ""political conditions in France.""The French government had welcomed the merger plan but went too far by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that exhausted the patience of FCA, sources told Reuters.Le Maire did not answer directly when asked if he would discuss the topic of the government's Renault stake with his Japanese counterparts on a visit to Tokyo the next day.""It's a long-term horizon. I think for now, it's wise to stick to the short and medium term,"" he said, reiterating the importance of beefing up the alliance.Le Maire's visit to Japan comes amid a period of strained relations between Renault and Nissan, after the arrest of former boss and alliance architect Carlos Ghosn in November.But the unequal relationship between them - smaller Renault has the bigger stake in Nissan - has long been a source of friction. Renault owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan has a 15% stake in its French partner.Le Maire will visit Tokyo on Monday to meet with business leaders and government officials including Finance Minister Taro Aso.

"By Marcelo RochabrunSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's oldest factory in Brazil, slated for closure later this year, was a giant among auto plants, occupying a sprawling 12 million square feet (111.5 hectares), bigger than many of the automaker's U.S. facilities.But in terms of spare capacity, the most important indicator of factory profitability, the historic Sao Bernardo do Campo plant, which still employs 3,000 workers, had become a dwarf. Closed more often than it was open, the plant's production lines sprang to life just three days a week. Ford announced on Tuesday it will close the factory and exit its heavy commercial truck business in South America as part of a global restructuring. Overall, Ford's Sao Bernardo plant produced 33,000 cars and heavy trucks in 2018, or just 11 vehicles per employee.An industry rule of thumb says an auto factory struggles to turn a profit unless it uses at least 80 percent of its capacity. In 2018, Ford used 12 percent of its car production capacity at the Sao Bernardo plant. In Brazil as a whole, Ford used 58 percent of its total production capacity last year, leaning heavily on a plant in the northeastern state of Bahia, where it receives significant tax incentives. Productivity troubles in Brazil are perhaps most severe at Ford but plague the industry as a whole, even as Latin America's largest economy rebounds from its deepest recession ever with double-digit growth in car sales.General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), now Brazil's sales market leader, produced cars equivalent to 78 percent of its capacity in 2018, up from 56 percent two years earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on capacity figures GM disclosed and production figures from local industry association Anfavea. Still, GM executives warned workers earlier this year that the company was experiencing ""a critical moment"" in the country amid heavy losses. Another top domestic producer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, produced cars equivalent to just 47 percent of its overall capacity, up from 36 percent in 2016, according to a similar calculation.Ford's heavy truck business, which will be discontinued in South America, operated at 19 percent capacity, according to Ford's own figures. The company said it could find ""no viable path to profitability"" for the unit. ""We know Brazil has excess capacity,"" said Leticia Costa, a Brazilian consultant and auto industry expert. ""This is a global problem for the auto industry but it's particularly true for emerging markets.""BOOM DAYS IN BRAZILBrazilians' mushrooming disposable income, along with hefty import barriers, encouraged automakers - led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG - to set up shop there and produce cars locally starting in the late 1950s. That turned Sao Paulo's industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo into the epicenter of what for a time was one of the world's top five auto producers. Volkswagen, whose Beetle was the market's sales leader in the industry's early boom days, did not respond to a request for comment on its capacity. But the high costs of local production and dependence on what turned out to be a fickle domestic market also sowed the seeds of the industry's hollowing out and dispersal into newer plants in far-flung states. The severe economic recession that began around 2013 hammered local producers. While the industry is recovering, it is still far behind its peak.But some plants can now build cars more efficiently. Ford's second plant in Bahia produces six times more cars than the Sao Bernardo plant, with 53 percent more workers, according to the company's website.""Fixed costs at that scale are sky-high,"" said David Wong, a management consultant and Brazilian auto industry expert.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will commit $10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he said on Monday.Cutting emissions will be challenging for Amazon. The e-commerce company delivers 10 billion items a year, has a massive transportation and data center footprint, and has faced criticism from within its own workforce.Bezos, the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires to dedicate substantial funds to battling the impact of global warming. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share."" The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants this summer as part of the initiative.""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said. Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for U.S. billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft's Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣ Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from U.S. vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands. Amazon has faced protests by environmental activists and pressure from its employees to take action on climate change.Amazon workers were among hundreds of employees of big technology companies to join climate-change marches in San Francisco and Seattle late last year, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action.Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an activist workers group, welcomed the Bezos Earth Fund announcement, but said it did not make up for the company's consumption of fossil fuels and other activities that contribute to climate change.""We applaud Jeff Bezos' philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,"" the group said on Twitter.

"By Ann SaphirSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The first public report on climate-related risks to financial markets ever commissioned by a U.S. market regulator will be out in June, the head of the group charged with writing it said on Wednesday. The report, by a 35-member panel formed last month by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ""will address both the short-term financial risks that may be associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, as well as the current and future market and financial risks associated with the physical risks that will arise from a warming climate,"" Bob Litterman, a partner at hedge fund Kepos Capital and the panel's chair, said at a public meeting held at the CFTC's Washington headquarters.It will include policy recommendations on oversight, including disclosures and stress testing against climate events, as well as ideas for new products for hedging against climate risk, he said, adding, ""Today the incentives around the world go in the wrong direction, and this has to change.""Regulators in Europe have begun to weave climate risks into their supervision of markets and banks. But U.S. regulators have been slow to respond to the threats that a warming planet can pose to financial assets. These include frequent wildfires and destructive hurricanes which may jeopardize the value of assets that underlie the trillions of dollars bought and sold in the world's biggest financial markets and the farmers, banks and insurers that use those markets.The Trump administration has sought to undercut a broad swath of U.S. and state regulations aimed at combating climate change and limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that cause it.In June, Rostin Behnam, one of two Democrats on the five-member CFTC, signaled he wanted to change that, announcing he would form a subcommittee to examine how climate change threatens not only the derivatives markets his agency oversees but the stability of the broader financial system.""No one else in the public sector is doing this,"" Behnam said in an interview this week. “I don't view this as a partisan issue. I view this as a matter of importance for our country.”The panel's members are a broad group, including representatives from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Dairy Farmers of America.Other U.S. financial regulators are watching.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess on Thursday said a victory by Democrat Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential race would better suit the German carmaker's efforts to mass produce electric cars across the globe.""A Democratic programme would be more aligned with our worldwide strategy to fight climate change to go electric,"" Diess said on a Bloomberg webcast on Thursday.Presidential candidate Joe Biden moved closer to victory in the U.S. election as officials continued to tally votes in the handful of key battleground states that will determine the outcome.VW is in the midst of a global push to launch electric vehicles in China, the United States and Europe, and is betting on economies of scale to make battery-driven cars more affordable.""The United States, when it comes to market share, is the weakest region in the world,"" Diess said.Diess added that Volkswagen had established a trustful relationship with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and that the prospect of trade tensions between the United States and other parts of the world would remain even if Biden won.Policymakers from all parties are determined to rebalance trade relations, in an effort to bring investment and jobs back to the United States, Diess explained.""The discussions would remain - you always have trade balances, which are a concern for some nations,"" he said. "
"By Nick Carey(Reuters) - Delivery fleet operators face regulatory pressure in California and other states to buy electric vehicles, but a surge in package deliveries thanks to coronavirus lockdowns has major firms itching to switch to electric right now.And they want far more than just battery-powered versions of diesel- or gas-guzzling trucks and vans. Fleet operators such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) hunger for computers on wheels that can harvest data and upgrade safety or autonomous features overnight to save money and boost profit.""For us, it's not just about making the wheels turn with a zero-emission vehicle,"" said Scott Phillippi, UPS's senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, who envisions ""Tesla-like"" vehicles in the company's vast fleet. ""It's about an integrated-technology vehicle - and that's really what we're pushing for.""With its ability to send wireless upgrades and fixes to customers' electric cars, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is seen as a bellwether for electrification. Major companies like UPS want to harness that power to bring cost-saving, autonomous or safety measures to their fleets in real time.If, for instance, a manufacturer developed a feature to prevent a truck from bumping into a loading dock, UPS could have it in tens of thousands of vehicles overnight to prevent expensive dents, Phillippi said.UPS, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and other e-commerce delivery companies are both creating and shaping the emerging market for electric vans and trucks. Economics and competitive advantages created by data will drive the market for electric commercial vehicles.Demand for electric commercial vehicles is accelerating in part because battery range, long a concern for fleets, has improved dramatically, while battery costs have fallen. UPS has ordered 10,000 vans from UK startup Arrival Ltd - the majority for the U.S. market - in which UPS also owns a minority stake. Arrival is working on self-driving technology, which is one reason why UPS is supporting the company, UPS's Phillippi said.The company has also reserved 125 of Tesla's long-awaited Semi big rigs, 50 electric trucks from Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) - with an option for 950 more - and is testing electric trucks with California startup Xos.Tesla's Semi was due to go into production in 2019, but is now slated for 2021. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans last year from startup Rivian Automotive LLC - in which it has invested - and ordered 1,800 more from  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz car and vans division for its European fleet last month.While demand is soaring, supply is still virtually non-existent and production has been beset by delays.""Ultimately, there's no trucks available yet,"" Phillippi said. ""We're just waiting for vehicles to show up.""The pressure is rising for manufacturers to deliver. Startups such as Rivian and Arrival are racing with larger, established vehicle makers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM) to get electric trucks into production.Startup Xos Trucks, for example, has begun low-volume production of vans with Mexican auto supplier Metalsa [MSDC.UL], a part-owner and strategic partner, using a ""modular"" battery approach where battery packs are added based on a customer's range needs. Xos Trucks Chief Executive Dakota Semler recounts the recent reaction of a customer when told their vehicles would be delivered in 2021. ""They said, 'What do I have to do get it by the end of this year?'"" Semler said.'ACTIVELY RAISING CAPITAL'The years-long journey of one electric delivery vehicle startup, California-based Chanje Energy Inc, shows the challenges vehicle makers and their customers face creating a new industry on the fly. California's decision in June to require commercial truck manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024, drew attention to the market. But Bryan Hansel, Chanje's CEO, said California's mandate made little difference. The surge in e-commerce delivery caused by the coronavirus pandemic had already caused fleet operators to zero in on the 50 miles per gallon (80 km per gallon) equivalent his vans offer versus the 6 to 8 mpg averaged by conventional diesel trucks.Back in 2018, package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) ordered 1,000 Chanje vans. But Chanje had to pause while its battery supplier, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750), updated its batteries' energy density. That boosted the range of Chanje's vehicles to 150 miles from 100 miles. Its 2021 model should have a range of 200 miles, Hansel said, making it capable of handling 90% of U.S. last-mile delivery routes - the ""last-mile"" of e-commerce where drivers drop off packages at individual consumers' doors is typically the most expensive.Chanje had to tackle other problems. Like other fleet operators, FedEx is not a fueling company - conventional fleets send vehicles to gas stations to fill up - so it lacked chargers for a large fleet. So Chanje became an energy services company, building out overhead charging stations at 20 FedEx depots across California to charge all 1,000 vans it will deliver in the first half of 2021.Chanje also has stepped up its software and electronics capability. After drivers reported the vehicles would roll backward if they took their foot off the accelerator on a hill, Chanje spent four weeks rewriting the code with a software fix. Then, according to Hansel, the company ""just flashed it over the wire to every truck we've ever built."" Chanje's vans are assembled in China by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (HK:0729), currently its main investor. ""But we are actively in the market raising capital because the capital markets seem to be very interested in the EV space right now,"" Hansel said. "

"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares tumbled to their lowest in nearly three years on Thursday after the company unveiled a wretched set of figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, hit by falling operating margins and big writedowns on investments in North American shale gas and elsewhere.The hit was so severe that the Anglo-Dutch giant said it would slow the pace of share buybacks to only $1 billion in the current quarter, from an average of $2.5 billion a quarter over the last 18 months. In the three months to December, it had bought $2.8 billion, but that had only been made possible by allowing the debt reduction target to slip. Gearing, the ratio of debt to equity, rose to 29.3% from 27.9% three months earlier – drifting further away from its medium-term target of 25%.Gearing, of course, depends on the value of the company’s equity as well as its debt, and that was hit by some painful writedowns, notably $1.65 billion mainly related to U.S. shale gas assets. The company joins an ever-growing list of majors forced to admitted their bet on shale has turned sour:   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX),   BP   (LON:BP) and Equinor (OL:EQNR) have all already taken similar hits, unable to escape the glut caused by associated gas coming out of new oil fields in the Permian and other shale basins.Other impairments, notably in Australia and Singapore, took the total value of writedowns in the quarter to $2.94 billion, although the company was also able to soften the blow by booking some non-cash gains on derivatives and deferred tax positions.It would be nice to think that Shell (LON:RDSa) will be able to move on after putting the writedowns behind it. Unfortunately, that looks like wishful thinking. Margins in refining and marketing, and in chemicals, all weakened against a backdrop of soft Chinese demand in the fourth quarter, and the increasingly obvious impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy leaves little scope for an improvement any time soon.The risk is that the coronavirus, having infected the Chinese economy, will force Shell (LON:RDSa) to choose between higher leverage or suspending buybacks altogether. In an extreme case, it may even be forced to resort to a scrip dividend again to avoid any further rise in debt levels, a tactic it last used to keep shareholders happy for a couple of years after the BG Group acquisition. The only safe bet would seem to be that the dividend -- one of the most important for European pension funds -- will continue to be paid at its current level in one form or another. At a yield of 6.86%, that is no small consolation to long-term investors.Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday that the company’s intentions to complete the $25 billion program remains unchanged. But that language is intentionally and justifiably vague. With Brent now trading below $60 a barrel and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies seemingly not in any hurry to make any further cuts to their own production, to promise anything more would be folly."

"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s a miserable, manic Monday for airline stocks across Europe thanks to a triple-whammy of bad news from France, Germany and the U.K.The biggest loser in early trading was Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), which fell as much as 8.4% after a report that it will step in to rescue the bankrupt Aigle Azur airline. EasyJet (LON:EZJ), which was also linked with making a bid for Aigle Azur, fell 3.2%.The news threatens a rerun – albeit on a smaller scale – of the Air Berlin fiasco two years ago, when Europe’s airlines passed up a golden opportunity to resolve problems of overcapacity in the short-haul segment, and instead carved up the collapsed operator's assets between themselves in an attempt to grab market share.As with the Air Berlin episode, there is the suspicion that the government will lean on the local national champion (then, Berlin and Lufthansa; now Paris and Air France-KLM) to come up with some of solution that minimizes job losses.The timing of the report is unfortunate, in any case. Air France-KLM published disappointing traffic figures for August earlier, showing the economic slowdown taking a heavy toll on its business.The number of the passengers carried by the Franco-Dutch group rose by only 1% from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year, they’d been up 3.2%. Passenger growth is no longer keeping up with AF-KLM’s capacity growth: available seat-kilometers were up 1.6%. In other words, the group is flying more empty seats across the world – so, not the best time to be buying more uneconomic capacity, one might think.Reminders of the sector’s recurring problems with overreaching were enough to push Ryanair (LON:RYA), Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) down by more than 2% each.Germany’s Lufthansa was a relative outperformer, losing only 1.9%. That’s despite comments by the head of Germany’s Christian Democrats on Sunday that she supported a new tax on flights in order to reduce carbon emissions. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview with state broadcaster ARD that a levy on flights could be “one way” forward, along with cutting value-added tax on less carbon-intensive rail transport. France already introduced a carbon-related tax on flights earlier this summer, and a rapprochement of policy between the EU’s two biggest countries could pave the way for a pan-European initiative to limit emissions from one sector where they are still growing rapidly.The third part of the triple-whammy Monday affected only one company: International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) fell 1.8% as British Airways pilots began their biggest strike in over 40 years, in search of higher pay and better working conditions. That news had, however, been mostly priced in.Elsewhere, Europe’s markets were mixed, with the benchmark STOXX 600 practically unchanged at 387.24. Italy's FTSE MIB led gains, up 0.3% to its highest level since late July. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1% along with the French CAC 40, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.2%. "
"(Reuters) - European shares dropped broadly on Thursday as investors shunned risky assets while waiting to see whether United States and China manage to avoid a trade war which would damage the global economy.The pan-European STOXX 600 index had dropped 0.7 percent by 0720 GMT, touching a fresh four-week low.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that China ""broke the deal"" it had reached in trade talks with the United States, and vowed not to back down on imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports.As the world's largest economies resume two-day trade talks on Thursday in Washington, investors were on the edge to see if a last minute truce could avert a sharp increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday.More than seven major sectors lost above 1 percent. Tariff-exposed auto stocks slid 1.6 percent decline while semiconductor stocks also lost ground.Adding to chipmaker's woes was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Corp's uninspiring full year outlook.Losses in heavyweight bank stocks weighed the most, with results from some of the biggest Italian banks in focus.Italy's third largest lender, Banco BPM dropped nearly 6 percent after reporting a halving of loan-loss provisions for the first quarter.Meanwhile, the country's biggest bank by assets UniCredit dipped even after it reiterated its 2019 targets and posted a net profit above analyst expectations.Among the biggest decliners were shares of ArcelorMittal after the world's largest steelmaker cut demand forecast for its key markets and said it was facing the twin challenges of lower steel prices and reduced consumption in Europe.German wholesaler Metro slid after reporting another quarter of falling sales at its Russian business and its Real hypermarkets, which the company is in the process of selling. Swiss drugmaker Novartis dipped on a deal to buy Takeda Pharmaceutical's eye drug assets for $3.4 billion.Shares of Norway's Equinor came under pressure after wage talks between Norwegian oil firms and their employees broke down.Investors sought safety in defensive stocks such as telecom, utilities and real estate which eked out the smallest losses.Germany's Rheinmetall was the top percentage gainer on the STOXX 600 after it confirmed its outlook and reported a rise in revenue in the first quarter, mainly driven by its booming defense unit.

"Investing.com - Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.1. Local Fed Forecasts See 4Q Growth StrugglingThe New York Federal Reserve’s GDP forecast dipped this week, pointing to fourth-quarter 2019 annual growth well below 1%.The New York Fed’s Nowcast came in at 0.7% Friday, down from its previous measure of 0.8%.“Negative surprises from lower than expected exports and imports data accounted for most of the decrease,” the Fed said.Business inventories also had a negative impact, while the Institute of Supply Management’s services measure helped.Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, also out Friday, had growth coming in at 1%, the same as its previous measure.2. Whales’ Really Are Behind The Big Moves in Bitcoin, Research FindsA sea of red washed over bitcoin Friday, sending some into a frenzied search for fundamental reasons for the move. More often than not, a clear reason for price swings has been found to be lacking, leading many to lay the blame at the feet of traders with sizable bitcoin holdings, bitcoin whales, able to move prices in a single swoop.But the role that the whales play in the crypto market may have been underestimated.New findings suggest that a single trader was responsible for the surge in bitcoin to nearly $20,000 two years ago.Finance professors John Griffin and Amin Shams at the University of Texas and Ohio State University claimed that bitcoin’s value between March 2017 and March 2018 was manipulated through large-volume trades.""This one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on bitcoin that is not observed in aggregate flows from other smaller traders,"" they wrote in a paper, which was shared with Bloomberg ahead of its publication in the Journal of Finance.But the professors are not the only ones shinning a light on the whales’ manipulation.Whale Alert, a site that keeps tables on moves in wallets for cryptocurrencies worth more than $50 million, identified a high number of high-value transactions that could explain the 20% downturn in bitcoin between October 21 and October 22.Underscoring the impact of whales on the price of bitcoin, Whale Alert co-founder and CEO Frank van Weert highlighted an address, inactive since 2011 and boasting 80,000 in bitcoin, that could “crush the market completely” if they decide to sell.Against the backdrop of overburdening pressure by the whales, some have suggested that an influx of new investors is needed to level the playing field.Institutional investors have been long courted by crypto markets, with many believing that Wall Street’s participation is needed for the next major rally.Products like bitcoin futures were launched to make crypto accessible to Wall Street.But that has brought in another class of whales, who reportedly were responsible for the reverse in bitcoin from its all-time high.A letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released in last year in May, suggested the slump in bitcoin from near $20,000 was largely driven by institutional investors following the launch of bitcoin futures.“The advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the San Francisco Fed said.3.  Disney  Promises Transparency on Subscriber NumbersWalt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) much-anticipated Disney+ streaming service debuts next week and there is some good news for investors looking to value the company’s shares.The company plans to supply granular information on how the service is performing, including subscriber numbers, a metric that will be very closely watched.Disney will provide subscriber numbers “on a go-forward” basis, Chief Financial Officer Christine Mary McCarthy said during the company’s post-earnings conference call.“(W)e intend to be very transparent as it relates to our (direct-to-consumer) business and the sub counts are going to be something we know people will be interested in,” McCarthy said. “So we will be providing by the different platforms subs by those platforms and because we'll be launching domestically, obviously we expect Disney+ domestically to have a head start on any of the international markets.”"
"By Nick Carey and Joseph WhiteDECATUR, Texas/FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Mickey McMaster is on his 12th pickup truck. The 61-year old farm equipment dealer in Decatur, Texas, two weeks ago treated himself to a 2019 GMC Denali for around $69,000 - a reward for long hours at work.“For me this is the Cadillac of trucks, it’s a real luxury vehicle,"" McMaster said. ""I’ve worked my way up to afford a truck like this and it shows that I’ve earned it.”  McMaster is the kind of customer General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is banking on as it plans to add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan that will build a new generation of its largest pickups. Demand from Texas and other heartland states for big pick-ups is providing a lifeline to many workers the No. 1 U.S. automaker is laying off at plants elsewhere. The Detroit Three automakers and thousands of their U.S. workers are counting on customers like McMaster to keep buying bigger and more luxurious pickup trucks even if overall U.S. vehicle demand weakens this year, as most analysts predict.At Flint, GM will build a new generation of its heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierras, including luxury models that are some of the most profitable vehicles on the planet. GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Ram division own the segment and are each doubling down with new or redesigned models launching this year. Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000. GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy-duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, that is now building all such trucks for the company. At the same time that GM is laying off thousands of U.S. workers and planning to shutter five North American factories, Flint is hiring. The plant runs on three daily shifts, six days a week. As the new model’s assembly system ramps up, the plant’s capacity will increase by more than 25 percent, plant manager Mike Perez told Reuters. The Flint plant plans to add 1,000 workers, more than half of the 1,500 factory workers who have asked to transfer from plants GM has targeted for shutdown as part of CEO Mary Barra's restructuring plan.“We’re bringing in 50 to 100 people every week,” said Perez.Workers last week were still finishing the job of retooling the Flint factory to build the new heavy-duty trucks as part of a $1.5 billion investment project. A highlight of the new assembly line: two-story tall Fanuc robots hoist a cab and a bed for a truck from separate pallets, swing them in opposing arcs, then gently lower them onto a truck frame to be bolted together by different robots. Detroit Three executives boast that the heavy-duty pickup market is protected by ""moats"" - a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks and decades of engineering that have yielded vehicles that haul 30,000 pound trailers, ride like large luxury sedans, and offer the same safety and connectivity technology as a BMW or Lexus luxury car.Pickup trucks account for three-quarters of the 235 or so new vehicles Carey “CW” Williams (NYSE:WMB) sells each month at his Decatur dealership. And nearly half of those are higher-end, luxury models that can sell for $70,000 or more.Williams said he is not concerned about the new Ram trucks as competition for GM. “Pickup trucks are our bread and butter, and we’ve got the new model to prove it with all the bells and whistles customers want,” he said.Mark Ary, 37, a second-generation owner of an HVAC installation/repair business, paid $65,000 for a white 2019 Silverado High Country. He liked the air conditioning for the truck's rear seats, its 360-degree cameras, and hands-free technology that allows him to call and text. “GM really stepped it up with the technology for the 2019 truck,” Ary said.'MASSIVE' TRUCKSFord, the leader in the heavy-duty pickup segment, will launch later this year versions of its F-series Super Duty pickups with a 7.3 liter gasoline engine - more than three times the displacement of the power-plant in a typical Ford Fusion sedan. Fiat Chrysler's Ram brand is revving up a redesigned lineup of heavy-duty pickups offering optional 12-inch display screens and a 6.7 liter  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) diesel engine that delivers 1,000 pound-feet of torque - enough to haul a 35,000 pound trailer. GM's Silverado and GMC heavy-duty trucks will offer new diesel engines, 10-speed transmissions and trailer-towing capability “well in excess of 30,000 pounds,” said Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM's large pickup and SUV programs.The new Chevrolet and GMC trucks coming down the Flint assembly line stand out from older models on the same line. They are taller and have more imposing hoods and grilles than the older trucks.“We wanted the truck to look massive,” Herrick said. HEAVY-DUTY INVESTMENTDetroit automakers are investing heavily to expand their profitable heavy pickup franchises beyond commercial and work customers. Each has luxury heavy-duty pickup models, such as Ram's Laramie Longhorn, Ford's Limited and Chevrolet's High Country. GM has developed a multi-model luxury truck sub-brand, GMC Denali. Now, 60 percent of GMC heavy-duty pickups sold wear the Denali badge, GMC global brand chief Duncan Aldred told Reuters. With a diesel engine, sticker prices top $70,000.Heavy-duty pickups are not subject to the same federal fuel economy rules as lighter trucks and sedans. They fall under less stringent standards applied to commercial trucks, where a vehicle's capacity for work allows for more fuel consumption. These pickups do not have mileage estimates on their price stickers as lighter trucks do.The growing sales of heavy-duty pickups and their evolution toward luxury, personal use vehicles is drawing criticism from advocates of curbing carbon dioxide emissions. ""With a 7.3-liter engine, Ford's new massive pickup deserves to be launched as the Ford Valdez,"" Dan Becker, director of the Center for Auto Safety's Safe Climate Campaign, wrote in an email. In Flint, the assignment to build GM's new heavy duty trucks is a lifeline for workers like Randy Randall, a 41-year GM veteran who said he has worked at several GM plants, moving when layoffs hit. Now, he checks trucks at the end of the Flint assembly line.Randall smiled as a screen in front of his GMC truck flashed a message that it had passed the tests. “It’s got a great future,” he said. "

"(Bloomberg) --  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc said it’s under investigation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for possible corrupt practices, the latest legal headache for the world’s biggest commodity trader.The probe comes after the London-listed company was subpoenaed last year by the U.S. Justice department for documents relating to its dealings in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela since 2007.Glencore said Thursday that the CFTC had notified it of investigations into whether the company and its subsidiaries ""may have violated certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and/or CFTC Regulations through corrupt practices in connection with commodities.""The company said it believes the CFTC’s investigations ""have a similar scope in terms of subject matter"" to the DOJ probe, which became public last July.The commodity trading industry is facing a multitude of bribery and corruption investigations in jurisdictions ranging from Brazil to the U.S., drawing comparisons with the early 1980s when Glencore’s founder Marc Rich was prosecuted for tax evasion.The director of enforcement at the CFTC said last month in a speech that the agency was investigating overseas fraud and manipulation under the Commodities Exchange Act.""Companies and individuals engaging in foreign corrupt practices should recognize that this sort of misconduct might constitute fraud, manipulation, false reporting, or a number of other types of violations under the CEA, and thus be subject to enforcement actions brought by the CFTC,"" James McDonald said in New Orleans.Glencore’s shares have declined about 8 percent since the DOJ started is investigation last year, even as most miners gained.

"(Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on Thursday while the dollar took a back seat as Joe Biden inched towards taking the White House following victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, although the Democrats looked unlikely to secure a Senate majority.Markets were trying to gauge the fallout from a splitgovernment, and expectations rose that a policy gridlock thatwould prevent greater regulation and limit fiscal stimulus couldalso force the hand of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Each of Wall Street's three major indexes were higher for a fourth straight day on Thursday while stocks in Europe followed Asian bourses to clock healthy gains. Meanwhile, longer-dated U.S. Treasuries ticked lower after Wednesday's huge gains and U.S. jobless claims data, pushing yields up modestly.COMMENTS:JEREMY SCHWARTZ, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH AT WISDOM TREE""If the Republicans keep the Senate it doesn't matter who is president.The market was expecting a very strong fiscal impulse, offset by higher taxes and that might have led to selling by some people. But as that has come off, tech (sector) has really run. There is an expectation that Biden will have a collaborative tone with (senate majority leader Mitch) McConnell, coming to an agreement about passing some stimulus and taking tax hikes off the table.So you keep the positive of low tax rates and a collaborative spirit which could bring some stimulus.Markets will look past some of developments such as Trump contesting the election results, as long as there are no other ramifications such as social unrest that spirals out of control.""JOHN PETRIDES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TOCQUEVILLE ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK""Nothing is set on stone yet but the market is getting what it wanted and that is Republicans holding the Senate and a Biden victory. That was one of the best case scenarios that the market was looking for.""By having the Republicans in the Senate, even though we don't know who the president is, it basically enforces that if Biden is elected president, he'll have a harder time passing through his tax plan which was to raise corporate. """"Now investors just need to set their expectations that it could be still several more days if not longer until we know who the official president is. If Biden does squeak out in some of these states, president Trump already has an army of attorneys to fight the process. Presumably if it were to flip and Trump were to pull it out, Biden would do the same and contest the result.We need to be patient here to see who will be President but if Republicans were to win the Senate, that I think that is key and that's why the markets are responding so positively.""PAUL EITELMAN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, SEATTLE""A protracted period with no known result could inject volatility into financial markets. What we do know is that the U.S. and global economy are both still in the early innings of a new cyclical expansion.

If any contesting is limited to recounting votes, we would expect the impact to be short lived; but if it becomes longer-lasting and adversarial by going through the Courts, then I suspect that will have longer term repercussions and safe haven currencies will outperform vs the US dollar.""ROBERT WOLF, FOUNDER, 32 ADVISORS, NEW YORK, NY""A split election with a Biden Presidency along with a GOP led Senate will lead to growth oriented stimulus such as infrastructure but without the likelihood of overly burdensome regulations nor big tax reform legislation being passed. It will also bring on a less volatile and much welcomed environment bringing the end to a White House governing by Twitter.""NOEL DIXON, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, BOSTON, MA""As the market sees it gridlock equals the opportunity to still pursue stimulus but constrain Biden from any major progressive impulses - higher taxes, higher regulation. The tones coming from McConell will be critical once the dust settles and Biden remains on top""FRÉDÉRIQUE CARRIER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT""While the equity market typically prefers gridlock, this isn’t always the case. Market participants have been clamoring for another large COVID-19 fiscal stimulus package, and have also begun to get their hopes up for an infrastructure spending package. These bills would probably be more modest in size and scope with a divided Congress. Fiscal stimulus could be delayed until after the inauguration, and an infrastructure package is no guarantee.""""But we think gridlock would be perceived positively for certain sectors. For example, it would mean that far-reaching fossil fuel, health care, and financial industry regulations would be much less likely.

"It's official. David Solomon will succeed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Wall Street firm's new CEO. The firm made the announcement on Tuesday, saying Solomon will become CEO and join the board on Oct. 1. Solomon's ascension to CEO was largely expected after he was named in March as the sole president of Goldman,  following the departure of his co-president Harvey Schwartz. With the formal announcement, Solomon can now begin to make changes to his leadership team.Blankfein will remain chairman through the end of the year, and then take the title of senior chairman after his retirement. “David is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,"" Blankfein said in the firm's statement. ""He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy.""Blankfein, who once joked that he would die at his desk, was the longest-serving Wall Street CEO after JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon. Taking the reigns of Goldman in 2006, Blankfein, a former gold salesman, navigated the firm through the financial crisis and the subsequent fallout in which the firm was demonized  and called the ""vampire squid"" of finance.He later helped improve Goldman's public image, serving as an elder statesman of sorts for the industry. Under Blankfein, Goldman has expanded away from its roots as a pure investment bank and  into new areas such as its consumer banking business, Marcus. Raised in a housing project in Brooklyn’s East New York neighborhood, he attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School through financial aid. Solomon cut his teeth as a banker at Bear Stearns before joining Goldman as a partner in 1999. He ran the bank's leveraged finance unit and rose up the ranks of the the investment banking business  with a reputation for being Goldman's point man on many key client relationships, including those with 3M, Disney's Bob Iger, and the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.He's also known for his work to address gender imbalance within Goldman's workforce, and for spearheading a task force to try and retain junior bankers. Solomon is also known for his unorthodox hobby: production of electronic dance music. Solomon, known as DJ D-Sol, recently released his first track, a dance remix of Fleetwood Mac's 1977 hit ""Don't Stop."""
"PARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is unlikely to name a new leadership team before the end of August or early September, sources close to the matter told Reuters.The airline has been hunting for a new boss to fill a gap left by the abrupt departure of chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac in May, after staff rejected a pay proposal aimed at ending strikes that have resulted in heavy losses.Air France KLM reported its second quarter results on Wednesday but did not give clues on the CEO search.""The initial timetable was - 'Let's strive for an announcement before end-July.' It was the will of the nomination committee to identify a candidate before the end of the month,"" said one of the sources.But disturbances ranging from media speculation about the potential candidates to AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) voicing an interest in buying a stake in Air France KLM and then dropping that plan, had complicated the process, said the sources.""So you lose a week here and there and it's August 1. It means nothing will happen before the end of the month. Everyone must go and come back from holidays,"" said one of the sources.In mid-July, Anne-Marie Couderc - the interim chairman of Air France KLM - had said in a memorandum seen by Reuters that the company hoped to have a new leadership team fully up and running by September.According to La Tribune.fr website, Air France-KLM's nomination committee is currently talking to one north American executive with a good knowledge of the airlines industry.Air France-KLM declined to comment on the situation.The French government has a stake of about 14 percent in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.

"By Manas Mishra(Reuters) - Two major shareholder advisory firms urged investors to vote against billionaire investor David Tepper's hedge fund demand that Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc immediately split the roles of chief executive officer and chairman, in a boost to the Botox maker.The recommendation from Institutional Shareholder Services LP and Glass Lewis & Co against the proposal of Tepper's Appaloosa gives firepower to Allergan Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders ahead of the drugmaker's shareholder meeting on May 1.""Their recommendations affirm our position that our plan to adopt separate Chair and CEO positions with the next leadership transition is the best approach for Allergan shareholders,"" Allergan said in a statement.However, an analyst said the recommendations were contrary to the views of many investors.""This news is likely to frustrate a sizeable group of shareholders and we continue to await the result of the vote,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said. Appaloosa has been pressing Allergan since last year to separate the two roles, and asked for an immediate split after Allergan said an independent member of its board would be chairman, but only at its next leadership change. Both the proxy firms said that an immediate separation of the roles was not necessary.""There are no significant concerns regarding the board's current leadership structure sufficient to suggest that an immediate split of the CEO and chairman roles is warranted at this time rather than at the next CEO transition,"" ISS was quoted as saying in the Allergan statement.Appaloosa said ISS' recommendations were ""baffling"" as they were inconsistent with the firm's support for a similar proposal last year, and asked shareholders to vote for its proposal.Allergan, under pressure to rescue the company's falling stock prices, launched a review of its strategy last year. But that review is likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit.Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review, and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of its depression treatment rapastinel.Allergan's shares have fallen about 12 percent in the past 12 months. They trade nearly 60 percent below their record high of $340.33 in 2015. "
"(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S has named Chris Vogelzang as its chief executive officer, ending months of speculation over who will steer Denmark’s biggest bank through the continuing fallout of its money-laundering scandal.The 56-year-old Dutchman and ABN Amro Group N.V. veteran will start June 1. He replaces Jesper Nielsen, who has been running Danske on an interim basis since October, when Danske’s dirty-money saga ended the career of Thomas Borgen.Russell Quelch, an equity specialist at Redburn in London, said that “the market will welcome the fact that it’s an external candidate. The bank needs to start afresh, post the money laundering saga.”Shares in Danske rose almost 3% after trading started in Copenhagen.Vogelzang “brings many years of management experience from the financial sector,” Danske said, including a stint from 2000 to 2017 at ABN Amro, the last eight years of which were as a member of its management board and head of its global retail and private banking activities.Danske has purged large chunks of its upper ranks after last year taking center stage in what may be Europe’s worst ever dirty money scandal. Denmark’s biggest bank revealed in a September report that a “large part” of around $230 billion that flowed through a non-resident Estonian unit over a nine-year period was suspicious.The saga wiped out almost half the bank’s market value last year, and triggered criminal investigations in the U.S. and across Europe. Borgen, who was ousted in October, had previously been in charge of Danske’s Baltic operations. Shortly after he left, Danske’s biggest shareholder got rid of the chairman, Ole Andersen.Danske had tried to replace Borgen earlier, but failed to get its initial candidate approved. The Financial Supervisory Authority rejected a proposal to have the bank run by Jacob Aarup-Andersen, a 41-year-old who runs Danske’s wealth business and who used to be the chief financial officer, citing his lack of relevant experience.Quelch at Redburn said he has questions about the choice of CEO. “The fact is that he has no previous CEO experience and turning Danske around isn’t going to be a simple task,” he said. “So in my view, the appointment is a tick-box exercise -- getting someone in the seat so that the group can start to move forward with the new strategy. But I don’t think he’s going to excite investors in terms of his experience. He obviously does have experience, but not CEO experience.”Vogelzang was once a candidate to become CEO at ABN Amro, to succeed Gerrit Zalm in 2017, who joined Danske’s board in March. But the Dutch state, which is a majority shareholder, and the supervisory board blocked the move. Not long after that, ABN cut several management jobs and Vogelzang left.Danske faces years of investigations as prosecutors across multiple jurisdictions sift through the evidence. Investors are hoping that having a new CEO will allow Danske to focus on its business amid fears that the scandal is driving away clients and investors.“Despite its current challenges, Danske Bank has all the prerequisites to continue to be a strong and competitive bank that creates value for all its stakeholders,” Vogelzang said in the statement.Borgen, 55, is reportedly among 10 former Danske bankers to have been met with preliminary charges as the laundering investigation continues. The development comes as Denmark takes several steps to tighten its anti-money laundering laws, including the possibility of prison sentences and considerably tougher fines.(Adds background on Vogelzang.)"

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG has financial firepower for acquisitions even with net debt of $26 billion, though the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to value takeover candidates, Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said in an interview. ""We generate a high free cash flow that allows us to not only finance our dividend but to direct capital to other purposes,"" Narasimhan told the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.Still, ""acquisitions have slowed recently from a structural perspective"" during the pandemic, he said. Narasimhan, a U.S. citizen who took over two years ago as CEO, acknowledged disappointment that Novartis' existing medicines had not proven more useful against COVID-19. For instance, the company, like others, abandoned a trial of its older malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine after it failed to help patients in scientific studies.Moreover, he said Novartis had hoped to be faster in developing new drugs against COVID-19 and could have potentially profited from more cooperation with smaller biotech companies. ""We concentrated more on our own in-house activities - and learned a lesson from it,"" he said.Many of the medicines that Novartis is supplying for patients stricken with COVID-19 come from its Sandoz generics unit. For now, Narasimhan said Novartis is not interested in selling Sandoz, but rather continuing work to boost its sales and profit margins squeezed by U.S. price pressure.""We believe at this time that we can do this best with Sandoz within the Novartis group,"" he told the newspaper.Novartis' share price has fallen 15% this year, compared to peer Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF)'s 2% rise.Beyond recent legal settlements in corruption cases that topped $1 billion, Narasimhan believes safety problems that emerged with new eye medicine Beovu have cost Novartis shares 10% of their value.""Challenge No. 1 was Beovu's launch,"" he said.

"(Reuters) - Glossier Inc, the online cosmetics company with a cult following among millennials, was valued at over $1 billion in a latest funding round led by Sequoia Capital, joining a clutch of billion-dollar makeup brands that are powered by the founders' social-media popularity.The series D funding round, which raised $100 million, included some existing and new investors such as Tiger Global Management and Spark Capital, Glossier said.Glossier's products have been worn by Beyonce, Chrissy Teigen, Miranda Kerr and other celebrities, and are known for their ""millennial pink"" packaging. The company, launched by U.S. lifestyle blogger Emily Weiss in 2014, has grown to over 200 employees and last year doubled its online sales to $100 million.Glossier was valued at $390 million after a $52 million funding round one year ago, according to PitchBook Data.With nearly 2 million Instagram followers, the brand has grabbed eyeballs with ads that feature everyday people, products that cater to a variety of skin tones and emphasize a natural, ""no-makeup"" look.The company earlier this month launched ""Play,"" a brand that sells more colorful, flashier makeup, as part of efforts to expand its customer base.Kylie Cosmetics, Pat McGrath Labs, Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Huda Beauty are some other brands with a valuation nearing or above $1 billion, according to media reports.Glossier on Tuesday also said it had hired Vanessa Wittman, a former finance executive at Dropbox and Yahoo-owner Oath Inc, as its new chief financial officer. ""Beauty consumers increasingly want to interact with brands and purchase products online,"" said Megan Quinn, general partner at Spark Capital. ""The industry's conglomerates are ill-equipped to retrofit their businesses to this new reality."" "
"By Lefteris KaragiannopoulosOSLO (Reuters) - The liquidity of Britain's short-term power markets is likely to fall by 10-20% if the country leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of October, a senior executive at the EPEX SPOT power exchange told Reuters.Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. If it does so without a deal, it would no longer be coupled to European power markets. In the case of a deal, however, cross-border trading will not be affected during a transition period agreed with the EU.The intraday and day-ahead markets are among the most liquid products of a power exchange. They represent power that is traded for use within the same day and electricity for physical delivery the following day.The high liquidity means that any loss of transaction volumes would hit profit at the power exchanges.""For our traders, it is clearly a disadvantage ... (A no-deal Brexit) is likely to have an effect on the liquidity of the market, particularly on the day-ahead time frame,"" said EPEX SPOT's director for public and regulatory affairs, Wolfram Vogel.Market liquidity would fall by 10-20% for intraday and day-ahead power trading combined, Vogel said without elaborating on how long it would take for the market to recover.EPEX did not have a detailed plan to compensate for any lost liquidity, a spokeswoman said.Cross-border day-ahead transactions in their current form will stop, added Vogel, and EPEX SPOT would instead organize local day-ahead auctions in Britain.Trading within-day electricity with Ireland, however, would remain unaffected, he said.EPEX SPOT is working on expanding in the Nordics and Vogel said the exchange's within-day and day-ahead operations in the region are likely to begin between November and January.A Norwegian license to operate day-ahead power trading is still pending, he said, together with more technical details that need to be finalised with the Nordic transmission system operators.EPEX SPOT is in contact with members that already trade in the Nordics, Vogel added, and its sales team is working on adding new customers, offering participation fee discounts.EPEX's parent, EEX, is Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) flagship power derivatives market. EEX already trades financial power derivative contracts in the Nordics, competing with Nasdaq (O:NDAQ) in the futures market.The start of operations in the Nordics will mean the end of Nord Pool's local monopoly in intraday and day-ahead trading."

"By John McCrankNEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange is taking steps to separate traders on the floor of its iconic 11 Wall Street building and employees of the NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday.The steps, which include mandating separate entrances and eating spaces for floor traders and staff, are aimed at reducing the likelihood that an event in the building's office tower will impact operations on the trading floor, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund, said in the memo, seen by Reuters.Non-working visitors to the NYSE floor have been kept to a minimum this week, the building has intensified overnight cleaning efforts, and an outside vendor will provide extra deep cleaning on weekends, it said.""Given the critical work by our NYSE and NYSE American floor communities to underpin the orderly function of global markets, all of these efforts, and others, will remain ongoing until further notice,"" the memo said.Concerns about how the fast-spreading coronavirus will affect the economy have led to global stock market routs, with volumes and volatility spiking to levels not seen since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.While nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, the NYSE says its hybrid electronic and floor broker model helps keep trading more orderly.But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut. The NYSE and exchange operators Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE), and IEX Group have all said they have regularly tested contingency plans in place to ensure continuous trading if the coronavirus leads to some facilities being temporarily shuttered.To reduce the chance of that happening, only NYSE and ICE staff who work in the 11 Wall Street's office tower will be able to eat in the NYSE cafeteria, the memo said. Those who work on the floor will have access to a special food service from NYSE's Trading Floor Coffee Kiosk.A restaurant on the exchange's 7th floor named 1792, after the year the NYSE was founded under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street, will be temporarily closed."

"By Nivedita Balu and Jaslein Mahil(Reuters) -  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) replaced its chief executive officer and chairman on Monday, days after the cosmetics giant rattled investors by warning that fiscal-year performance could be hurt by supply chain issues.The company said retail industry veteran Pierre Laubies would replace Camillo Pane as its chief executive officer, its fourth CEO in as many years.Coty Chairman Bart Becht is also ceding the role to fellow director Peter Harf, but will stay on the board.The new executives are associated with JAB Holding Co, a consumer goods to coffee conglomerate that is the private investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. Both Harf and Becht run JAB, which has a 39 percent stake in Coty and is also a majority shareholder of Dutch beverage company Jacobs Douwe Egberts, where Laubies was the CEO until December 2017.The management shakeup comes as Coty struggles to integrate the 41 beauty brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble (N:PG) in 2016. Last week, the company said supply chain problems from a trucker strike in Brazil, hurricanes in the United States and a warehousing issue in Germany were making it difficult to integrate the brands quickly. It also issued a profit warning that wiped out more than a fifth of its market value. ""(The changes are) not that surprising given the poor performance of the company and the additional supply chain issues that have come about,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser.Becht had handpicked Pane as Coty's CEO in 2016, but shares have fallen 64 percent since his appointment. Both executives previously worked at  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), where Becht once served as CEO.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said the degree of senior level leadership changes at Coty over the last two years has been overwhelming. Coty's new CEO Laubies is likely to face challenges that were similar to those at JDE, which he led for more than four years and was responsible for overhauling a mass coffee brand in a highly competitive market, said Jonathan Feeney, managing partner at research firm Consumer Edge.""Certainly some of the challenges of the COTY Consumer Beauty business rhyme with those of JDE,"" Feeney said.Laubies has also worked at confectionary company Mars Inc and soup maker  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB). Coty shares were up nearly 4 percent on Monday afternoon. "
"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s asset-management unit, which oversees $250 billion for insurers, said an economic slowdown in the U.S. is the biggest investment risk for the industry for the first time since the financial crisis.“Insurers expressed a growing consensus that we are in the late stage of the U.S. credit cycle,” the Goldman unit said in a report following a survey of 300 senior insurance executives. “With rates expected to rise and equity valuations high, insurers are concerned with achieving adequate returns without leaving their portfolios exposed in the event of a downturn.”Inflation expectations have also risen in the U.S. as rising protectionism damps prospects for global growth, adding to the concerns about the economy. That could be a double whammy for insurers, cutting the value of their portfolios in the short term and probably increasing the claims paid by non-life insurers over the long term.In 2017, “people were expecting inflation to become an issue in five years,” Etienne Comon head of insurance in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said at a media briefing. ""Now this has been brought forward -- more view inflation becoming an issue within the next two to three years.”Executives plan to cut risk in equities and credit, increase liquidity in their portfolios and reduce the duration of their exposures as interest rates rise, the survey shows. High-yield debt, tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. equities are among the investments that managers plan to decrease. Infrastructure debt, commercial mortgage loans and corporate credit for mid-market firms are areas where they want to allocate more capital.Cryptocurrencies, while being much debated, are not believed to be suitable investments for portfolios at this stage, while a third of those surveyed view them as a potential risk to financial markets."

"By Vibhuti Sharma(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) is raising monthly fees for its U.S. subscribers by between 13 percent and 18 percent, the video streaming pioneer's first price increase since 2017 as it spends heavily on original content and international expansion.Prices for its popular standard plan, which allows streaming on two devices at the same time, will rise to $12.99 per month from $10.99, the company said in a statement.Netflix shares rose 6.5 percent to close at $354.64, adding to their 30 percent rise so far this year.The company's top-tier plan, which allows streaming on four screens in high definition, will increase to $15.99 from $13.99 per month, while the fee for its basic plan will rise to $8.99 from $7.99.In comparison, AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Now streaming service charges $14.99 per month, while Hulu's no-advertisements plan is priced at $11.99 per month.""It highlights that Netflix has pricing power and even after the increase it remains a very cheap entertainment alternative,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said.Netflix has been spending billions to bolster its original content, which boasts award-winning shows such as ""The Crown,"" ""Black Mirror"" and ""Wild Wild Country"" to fend off intensifying competition from players such as Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime Video service and Hulu. The company reported it had 137 million customers at the end of September.The price hikes are expected to fetch Netflix hundreds of millions of dollars, ahead of the launch of streaming services from AT&T and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).While aggressive spending - a planned $8 billion in 2018 - has led to a surge in subscriber growth, its debt doubled to $6.50 billion in 2017 from $3.36 billion in 2016.The company is expected to have a debt level of $8.33 billion in 2018, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co, which owns 15,019 shares of Netflix.Netflix is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after market close on Thursday.""With Netflix frequently tapping the debt markets on several recent occasions, the price hike could help ease concerns with a growing deficit on free cash flow to fund a likely continued escalation in Netflix's content spending, which likely topped $13 billion in 2018,"" CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi said.

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A group of 39 companies, including several of Brazil's largest firms, expressed concerns over deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest on Tuesday, following global investor demands that President Jair Bolsonaro end the destruction or risk divestment.While weaker than the threats from the global investment firms, the joint statement is the first from such a broad and powerful group of Brazilian companies since Bolsonaro became president, and signals that corporate pressure for action is building within the country. The rate of destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest climbed 34% in the first five months of the year from a year ago after hitting an 11-year high in 2019, government data shows. Environmental advocates blame the expanding destruction on Bolsonaro, who has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region while also deploying the military to fight clear cutting and fires.The signatories on the statement include many of Brazil's largest listed companies, such as the bank Itau Unibanco (SA:ITUB4), miner Vale (SA:VALE3), brewer Ambev (SA:ABEV3), and state-owned electric utility Eletrobras (SA:ELET6). Regional or Brazil chiefs for international companies also signed on, including oil firm Shell (L:RDSa), Microsoft (O:MSFT), agrochemical maker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and commodities trader Cargill.Seven major European investment firms controlling more than $2 trillion told Reuters last month they will divest from Brazilian assets if they see no progress on stopping Amazon deforestation.Tuesday's statement did not include an ultimatum, but said the companies were available to work with the government to devise solutions. Strong enforcement of environmental laws is necessary, the companies said.""This group has been increasingly attentive to and concerned about the impact on businesses of the current negative perception of Brazil's image internationally when it comes to the social and environmental issues in the Amazon,"" they said.
