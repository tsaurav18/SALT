"(Bloomberg) -- With just three weeks to go, 2018’s market contrarians are proving prescient.The outlook was decidedly bullish for U.S. stocks and developing-nation assets 12 months ago, with both forecast to build upon a stellar 2017. The beaten-down greenback wasn’t expected to fare any better in 2018, as a rosy international growth outlook threatened to lure investors away from American markets. And despite some tough talk between the U.S. and China, risks of an all-out trade war were an afterthought.Not much has gone according to plan, but DWS, Cantor Fitzgerald and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were among the few who bet against the trend and got it right. Federal Reserve rate hikes against a backdrop of sharply escalating trade tensions roiled markets in 2018, punishing U.S. stocks and causing risk-averse investors to flee developing nations. Meanwhile, the down-and-out dollar has gained against virtually all major currencies amid rising rates and buoyant U.S. growth.Here’s what those who called 2018 correctly expect in the new year:Stalling DollarStefanie Holtze-Jen, chief currency strategist at asset manager DWS, is among the vindicated.In February, after the dollar’s worst annual slide in 14 years, she called for the greenback to strengthen to $1.15 per euro by March 2019, from the prevailing level of about $1.23. The argument that the U.S.’s twin deficits would depress the dollar was over-hyped, according to Holtze-Jen, who saw extreme bearish positioning setting up a rebound.The dollar’s rally starting in mid-April proved her right -- inflicting pain on global investors. But Holtze-Jen doesn’t expect another strong year for the greenback. She sees the euro ending next year at $1.15 as slowing growth and European political woes weigh on the common currency, while the Fed approaches the end of its hiking cycle. Expectations for Fed rate increases have crumbled, with markets now pricing in less than a quarter-point of tightening in 2019.Most forecasters expect the euro-dollar pair to reach $1.20 by the end of 2019, according to a Bloomberg survey, from about $1.14 now.“The Fed has come back from autopilot,” said Holtze-Jen. “Their calls will be more data-dependent. That’s something that takes the needle lower on the dollar going forward.”U.S. Equities GloomWhen it comes to U.S. stocks, 2018’s bears are still skeptical. For months, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Peter Cecchini has forecast the S&P 500 to finish the year at 2,805, one of the more bearish projections among Wall Street’s strategists, and almost 7 percent above Friday’s close.A deceleration in U.S. growth, driven in part by higher funding costs on tighter financial conditions, and a frothy commercial and industrial loan market will create credit stress next year, according to Cecchini.“Our disposition towards equities has moved from buy-the-dip to sell-the-rally,” said Cecchini, Cantor’s chief global market strategist. “If I’m not constructive on the credit markets, then I won’t be constructive on the equity markets.”He has company in his pessimism. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, the biggest equity bear on Wall Street, forecast last month that the S&P 500 will end 2019 at 2,750, the same target he called for this year. As the fiscal boost from tax cuts wears off and global growth decelerates, Wilson expects a “material” deceleration in corporate profits.That’s at odds with what most strategists expect. The average prediction as of the end of November was for the S&P 500 to climb to 3,056 by the end of next year, according to 14 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg. It’s the most optimistic year-ahead call since 2009.Emerging CheerJordi Visser at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, who predicted the peak of the developing-market rally in late January, expects emerging markets to be a bright spot in 2019 as the dollar stumbles. Visser is calling for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) to outperform the S&P 500 Index by 15 percent to 20 percent in 2019. Chinese Internet stocks, developing-nation sovereign debt and emerging-market currencies look particularly attractive.""Bullishness comes from an expectation of a weaker dollar next year on the back of easier U.S. monetary policy, the lag of recent Chinese stimulus measures and a focus of value as a factor in 2019 rather than growth,"" said New-York based Visser, chief investment officer at the $1.7 billion hedge fund.Tania Escobedo, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC who correctly called a slide in the Brazilian real this year when most of the market was bullish, now has another contrarian call for 2019. She’s wagering against the real and going long the Mexican peso. Most investors are optimistic about Brazil’s incoming government and concerned about the populist rhetoric from Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.There are “pockets of value” in emerging markets, including Argentina’s beaten-down currency, Lisa Chua, a New York-based money manager at Man GLG, said in an interview last month. The firm boasted this year’s top developing-nation debt fund with more than $1 billion under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Trade ReminderA year ago, Jens Nordvig at Exante Data LLC was cautioning that the markets weren’t adequately priced for a building U.S.-China trade dispute, as concern about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program garnered more attention. Now he expects trade tensions will remain a focal point in 2019, even after the world’s two biggest economies appear to have reached a tentative truce on tariffs.“China will try to delay and delay, but not give in on the big stuff,” said Nordvig, Wall Street’s top-ranked currency strategist for five years running before founding Exante. “By the second quarter, the U.S. will have to decide if they agree to some cosmetic concessions, or whether they are actually ready for a sustained trade war.”",1,2

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators on Thursday said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) should stop working with delivery contractors that violate labor laws by imposing unfair conditions on drivers delivering packages for the e-commerce company.The senators, in a letter https:// to Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, responded to reports that alleged Amazon pressured contractors and more broadly avoided regulatory scrutiny. Amazon said in a statement it had taken steps to ensure ""a strong safety and labor compliance record across our transportation network of employees and contractors, and we continue to drive improvements that benefit our transportation providers, our customers and the public.""The company added it has ""strict requirements for safety and labor wages and working conditions that meet or exceed the law. We also require comprehensive insurance, competitive wages, working hours and numerous other safeguards for our delivery service providers and regularly audit to ensure compliance.""The letter was signed by Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown.Buzzfeed on Aug. 31 said Amazon was creating what it called exploitative conditions for driver contractors by pushing them to deliver upwards of 250 packages a day.Amazon had told Buzzfeed it expects its delivery operators to comply with labor laws.Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang had last week also called for increased regulation of Amazon's delivery network.

"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. investors looking to get into the volatile Chinese stock market without the cross-border hassle can find a slice of the action in their own backyards.A slew of Chinese technology companies listed in the U.S. via American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, have taken shareholders on a roller-coaster ride in the past few days. They include Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed NIO Inc., which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as well as Pinduoduo Inc., HUYA Inc., and 58.com Inc.NIO, the electric car-maker that’s accrued $1.6 billion in losses since the start of 2016, jumped 85 percent in two days after its $1 billion initial public offering. NIO Chief Financial Officer Louis Hsieh on Wednesday blamed the low initial price on bad timing, with recent losses in Asian markets making domestic investors “too jittery” to buy.Just a day after the interview, NIO’s shares surged 76 percent -- leading gains across other U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies. Pinduoduo, the e-commerce platform operator, jumped as much as 32 percent Thursday. The stock is up 58 percent since its July debut. ADRs from iQIYI Inc. jumped 6 percent on Thursday while 58.com closed up 9.3 percent.The list might grow longer as Qutoutiao Inc. -- the Chinese news and video aggregation app that’s also backed by Tencent -- is scheduled to begin trading after an expected IPO pricing this week in the $7 to $9 range.“Shares are gaining likely because overnight gains in NIO shares rekindled investors’ interest in new energy vehicles and the broad auto sector,” said Tian Yang, Hong Kong-based analyst with China Securities International. “That has helped sentiment and we don’t see any change in sector fundamentals.”The biggest China tech ADR of them all, however, has made little headway this year.

"By Sujata RaoLONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed half a percent on Monday, attempting to brush off fresh rises in global bond yields while equity futures also pointed to a firmer session on Wall Street which suffered its worst week in two years.A higher Friday close for New York stocks following a week of ""vol"" induced selling, lifted markets in Asia and Europe, helping MSCI's all-country index rise off four-month lows, while European shares firmed 1.4 percent after touching six-month troughs last week. Wall Street's equity volatility gauge, the VIX - the spike in which had kicked off the ructions - was at 26.5 percent, easing off Friday's 29 percent close.While the index had rocketed to 50 at the height of last week's turmoil, current levels are well above the long-term average around 11 percent, in a sign that investors' nerves are still jangling.The continued move-up in bond yields is reinforcing the fear of more volatility ahead. Ten-year Treasury yields hit new four-year highs around 2.90 percent, while German yields, the benchmark for Europe, hovered just below 0.8 percent, the 2-1/2-year high touched last week.""People are nervous after the shock of the past week but it doesn't feel like there is a crisis around the corner. But never say never,"" said Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.Given solid world economic growth, Lewis said the falls were more likely a wobble than a full-blown correction to the nine-year long equity bull market as bond investors priced in an improved economic outlook.""Even at 2.90 percent, 10-year Treasury yields are still low,"" he added.U.S. equity futures rose 1 percent.Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed equity funds had cut long positions in S&P 500 futures, reducing exposure to a market which has fallen about 8 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. INFLATION, DOLLARWhile equity markets attempt to recover, the question is whether they can withstand another sharp move up in bond yields - something will be put to the test by economic data this week.In China, banks extended a record amount of new yuan loans in January, blowing past expectations, which is likely to support growth not only in China but underpin liquidity globally.Analysts forecast U.S. consumer price inflation, to be released on Wednesday, to have slowed to 1.9 percent in January from a year earlier, while the core measure is seen ticking down to 1.7 percent.Given it was fears of faster inflation - and more aggressive rate rises - that triggered the global rout in the first place, an above-forecast figure could well spark a fresh selloff in stocks and bonds.Central bankers have not exhibited much concern over the equity rout, indicating they intend to push on with plans to tighten monetary policy this year.On currency markets, traders had cut net short positions in the dollar last week, CFTC data showed, but speculators returned on Monday to short the dollar, pushing it 0.2 percent lower versus a basket of currencies. Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said the risk bounce was being countered by the steeper U.S. bond curve but the soft dollar showed the former currently had the upper hand.The gap between short- and long-dated U.S. yields is at the widest in more than three months - the so-called curve steepening which indicates higher inflation expectations and economic activity.""If a better risk mood just encourages 10-year Treasuries to spike up through 2.9 percent, it seems unlikely that we will see equities bounce too far and by the same token, it's too early to sell dollars,"" Societe Generale warned clients.The euro rose around 0.2 percent, after losing 1.8 percent last week, while the yen eased off five-month highs hit last week amid the flight to safe-havens.Sterling meanwhile inched higher, off last week's three-week lows but Britain's shaky economy and rocky Brexit process kept it fragile.Monday's more cheerful market mood also lifted commodities, with Brent crude futures rising two percent after last week's 9 percent fall, copper bouncing off two-month lows and gold up 0.2 percent, well off five-week troughs.

"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit soared 200% due to surging demand for its  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) games console, and that title Animal Crossing: New Horizons shifted a record 13.4 million units in its first six weeks.The Kyoto-based gaming company posted operating profit of 89.4 billion yen for January-March, Reuters' calculations showed based on annual figures, smashing analyst estimates.Nintendo has defied scepticism over its ability to draw in consumers beyond a hardcore base in the Switch's fourth year with the runaway success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has become the console's fastest-selling title since launching on March 20.The appeal of the title among consumers looking for escapism in coronavirus-hit economies around the world underscores Nintendo's games-maker credentials at a time when investors have been frustrated by the company's conservative management, which includes what many regard as a half-baked foray into mobile gaming.Nintendo said it expects to sell 19 million Switch console units in the current financial year. Its forecasts are widely viewed as conservative.""Animal Crossing's impact was bigger than expected but is temporary,"" CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said, adding he did not see the company's forecasts, which include a fall in full year software sales to 140 million units, as conservative.In the year ended March, Nintendo sold 21 million Switch consoles, well above its forecast of 19.5 million.That breaks down as 14.8 million units of the hybrid home-portable device and 6.2 million units of the handheld-only Switch Lite, which went on sale in September.SHORTAGES The popularity of the device and the coronavirus outbreak's impact on supply chains has led to Switch shortages around the world, preventing the company from taking full advantage of pent-up demand.The company said production and shipping are ""gradually recovering"" following pandemic-induced delays but pointed to the risk of further disruption including to games development. ""It is difficult to expect the same productivity"" from employees working at home, Furukawa said, adding delays to game releases are a possibility if the crisis is protracted. Nintendo has provided few details of upcoming titles, risking putting a break on sales momentum as studios across the world scramble to mitigate disruption from the virus. Rival Sony Corp (T:6758) has already announced delays to high-profile releases. ",1,1
"Investing.com - Hong Kong-listed tech giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) is planning to roll out the “Call of Duty Mobile” to the U.S., Europe and Latin American markets, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.Call of Duty is a first-person shooter title and is one of the best-selling game franchises of all time, Bloomberg said. Tencent’s mobile version is currently in beta-testing and does not have a set-date for a full public roll-out.The article added that Tencent is adapting popular titles for mobile and exporting them to overseas amid slowing growth and regulatory clampdowns in China.It was reported previously that the Chinese government is banning violent content online and restricted screen time for youngsters.Citing Vincent Gao, the overseas marketing director for the Tencent’s Timi Studio Group, the article said the company will hire more developers abroad to tap the overseas market.“We’ve accumulated a lot of experience from developing mobile games in the past, and we think we have a pretty good chance of exporting our know-how,” Gao said in an interview. “In the future, we plan to introduce more categories with top-tier game developers.”",1,1

"Just as the Federal Reserve is thought to use policy to protect equity markets, Saudi Arabia tries to manage crude oil prices by manipulating its production levels writes Phil Flynn of The PRICE Futures Group.You have heard about the so-called Fed put. That is a term that means the Federal Reserve has the markets back. If the markets or economy start to falter, the Fed’s plunge protection team will get into gear and adjust monetary policy to create a floor for the market. That in turn gives investors confidence to take on more risk because, even if the market gets weak, the Fed won’t allow it to crash.With the recent rebound in crude oil, traders are now talking about the Saudi put. That is that Saudi Arabia will not allow oil prices to fall and if it does, they will cut production accordingly. In fact, the Saudi announcement that they want $80 a barrel for crude, and that they will reduce their exports by 800,000 barrels-per-day is sending a signal to the market that the worst for oil may be over.Of course, Saudi Arabia’s power to manipulate the price of crude oil has diminished some in the age of shale, and it helps that the global stock markets are showing more optimism. So called progress on the U.S.-China trade discussions is bringing the risk appetite back into the marketplace and cumulative measures talked about in Asia to boost their economy is changing the pessimism about overall energy demand. A senior Chinese official said China plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. This comes after China lowered their reserve requirement for bank lending that, along with more stimuli should raise oil demand expectations.This comes as the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan. 4, according to sources. This massive drop in supply is showing that previous cuts by the Saudis are already showing up and this could be the beginning of a massive drain on U.S. oil supplies.Of course, that is looking forward. In the short term, the big drop in crude was offset by mindboggling builds in products. The API reported that gasoline stockpiles surged by an astounding 5.5 million barrels, while distillate inventories rocketed by 10.2 million barrels. The post market reaction seemed to shrug off the product build and focus more on the crude draw.U.S. shale operators are still in pullback mode and with the OPEC cuts about to drain our supplies; the bottom in oil looks solid. Of course, if we see a reversal or panic in stocks that could change, but for now the new oil uptrend will be your friend.Yet despite the price drop in the big picture, energy supply prospects for the future continue to brighten. Reuters reported that  BP  (LON:BP) struck black gold discovering two new oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico that could bring an additional billion barrels of oil at an existing field, thanks to new seismic technology.Reuters writes: “The company has put a heavy emphasis on technology and data processing capabilities in recent years in order to unlock new resources and cut costs. The $1.3 billion Atlantis Phase 3 development will include drilling eight wells and a new subsea production system that will boost BP’s production by 38,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day. It is scheduled to start production in 2020. Together with the new discoveries, BP aims to grow its Gulf of Mexico production from over 300,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day at present to 400,000 by the mid-2020s. BP said that new seismic technology helped it identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil at its Thunder Horse field within weeks, whereas previously it would have taken a year to analyze.”Remember peak oil and you can’t drill your way to energy independence? Neither do I.Hellenic Shipping News reports that the middle distillates complex in Asia rolled out 2019 on diverging paths. While the gasoil market has made a strong comeback since plummeting to its lowest level on Dec. 21, co-distillate jet fuel continued to remain sluggish. Market sources said that this trend was likely to continue for the rest of the month, citing diverging fundamentals between the two products.Despite the Asian gasoil market kicking off the year on a steady footing, some traders cautioned that looking forward; the middle distillate might be on track for a sustained recovery from here. Some traders hold a more bullish sentiment for the Asian gasoil market in the near term, pointing out that volumes flowing out of the region have helped to ease the overhang in supply. “For January, Asia exported over 1 million mt of gasoil out of the region,” a trader said, adding that gasoil might see an overall improvement in fundamentals.Conversely, the Asian jet fuel/kerosene spot market started the year on a weaker footing, as a glut of surplus cargoes pressured cash differentials deeper into discount territory. While demand has been steady amid the ongoing winter season, market participants continued to point to a ready availability of cargoes from South Korea and China.",1,2
"By Rajendra JadhavMUMBAI (Reuters) - India arrested the head of a bankrupt realty company on Thursday after lender Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) accused executives of partaking in a ""criminal conspiracy"" involving forged audit reports that cost the bank some 43.55 billion rupees ($616.5 million).In the latest case to roil India's banking sector, PMC made a police complaint accusing its own executives and officials at Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) of misleading the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 2008 to August 2019 by forging the audits to hide the fact that big accounts had become non-performing assets.The RBI last week took charge of the bank and suspended Managing Director Joy Thomas and the bank's board after uncovering lending irregularities. PMC has been barred from renewing, or granting any loans, or making investments without the RBI's prior approval.Depositors have been informed they can only withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees ($140) from their PMC accounts over the next six months. On Tuesday, dozens of account holders gathered outside an RBI office in Mumbai to protest against the curbs and demand that the central bank and government intervene to release their funds.On Thursday evening, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police arrested HDIL's chairman Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan as well as his son Sarang Wadhawan, the bank's vice chairman, Mumbai Police?spokesperson?Pranaya Ashok told Reuters. He declined to provide information about the charges against them.Reuters was not immediately able to contact the two Wadhawans. HDIL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the past two years, India's troubled banking sector has been rocked by a multibillion-dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.Indian media outlets on Sunday reported that PMC's exposure to HDIL stood at 65 billion rupees, which accounts for 73% of its overall 88.8 billion loan book. That is well above the RBI's permissible exposure levels to a single entity.PMC could not immediately be reached for comment on the estimate.More than two dozen co-operative banks are now under RBI administration. PMC, among the top five co-operative banks in the country with deposits of 116.2 billion rupees as of March 31, is by far the largest.India has more than 1,500 small urban co-operative banks that typically service small local communities in certain districts or states.

(JO:AMSJ) declared its biggest dividend since 2008 as the company reported full-year earnings that nearly doubled, thanks to a weaker rand and surging prices for sister metal palladium. The Johannesburg-based miner’s shares have risen 104% in the past 12 months.While rivals such as Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Lonmin Plc are also benefiting from higher prices for palladium and rhodium, which they dig up alongside platinum, Amplats is in a particularly strong position. The company resumed dividends last February after a six-year hiatus, during which it sold and wound down older, less profitable operations.Palladium has surged 47 percent to successive records since the end of August. Demand for the metal, used primarily in the auto industry for catalytic converters in gasoline engines, is projected to exceed supply for an eighth straight year in 2019. The South African currency has also weakened 18 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, which lowers costs at local mines.Amplats said it expects the three major platinum-group metals -- platinum, palladium and rhodium -- will again be in a combined deficit in 2019, although platinum itself will see a “modest” surplus. Palladium will be in a “strong and widening” deficit this year, the company said.“Automotive demand seems set to increase, even with little or no growth in vehicle sales, as average vehicle size increases and emissions rules tighten,” it said.Amplats rose as much as 2.6 percent on Monday to 708.89 rand a share, the highest since February 2011.The company’s strong balance sheet will enable it to increase investment in projects with low capital requirements and fast payback, while it advances studies to boost output at its key Mogalakwena mine that’s highly geared toward palladium, Ian Botha, the outgoing finance director, said on a conference call.Amplats plans to complete studies by about 2020 to add annual output of 270,000 ounces of palladium and 250,000 ounces of platinum at Mogalakwena, Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said. The expansion may take about four to five years, he said.Meanwhile, Amplats expects the palladium deficit to persist until there’s a meaningful move by auto makers to substitute platinum in their designs, the CEO said.",1,1
"By J?rn Poltz and Arno SchuetzeMUNICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, who is being investigated over his role in Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) emissions test cheating scandal.Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel. The affair has so far cost the German carmaker 30 billion euros ($33.5 billion).The public prosecutor's office in Munich said Stadler and three other defendants are being charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Stadler has denied any wrongdoing, his lawyer said.Premium brand Audi only admitted in November 2015 that its 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device which was deemed illegal in the United States.Volkswagen and its former managers have faced numerous law suits, and in April prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig charged former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud over his role.The Munich prosecutor said that three of the defendants are accused of having developed engines for Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche cars that used emissions cheat devices. ""Defendant Stadler is accused of having been aware of the manipulations since the end of September 2015 at the latest, but he did not prevent the sale of affected Audi and VW vehicles thereafter,"" the prosecutor said in a statement.Stadler was arrested in June 2018 as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, which is part of Volkswagen Group, and spent several months in prison.Volkswagen later terminated Stadler's contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions tests cheating. The prosecutors said that his indictment relates to roughly 250,000 Audi branded cars, 112,000 Porsches and 72,000 Volkswagen cars that were sold in the U.S. and Europe.'PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE' The defendants charged by the Munich prosecutor include former Audi and Porsche manager Wolfgang Hatz as well as two engineers, several people familiar with the proceedings said.Hatz, former research and development chief at Porsche and former head of powertrain development at Audi and parent Volkswagen, spent several months in custody in 2017 and 2018 over his alleged role in the emissions cheating scandal. A lawyer for Hatz separately said his client denied any wrongdoing.The Munich prosecutors on Wednesday declined to identify the defendants, except for Stadler.Investigations against 23 further suspects continue, the prosecutor's office said. The Braunschweig prosecutors had said that Volkswagen's emissions cheating took place between November 2006 and September 2015, and that Winterkorn failed in his duty to inform European and U.S. authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated. Winterkorn had also neglected to inform customers of, and did not prevent, the continued installation of fraudulent software, the prosecutors have said.Winterkorn's lawyer has said he cannot comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.Audi said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in the interest of the company, its shareholders and employees to clarify the issues that led to the diesel crisis.""Until this has happened, the presumption of innocence must prevail,"" the spokesman said.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis's shift into high-tech drugs won praise for providing patients with new options but criticism over prices that may run into the millions of dollars at the Swiss drugmaker's annual general meeting on Thursday. Shareholders at the event in Basel also approved Novartis's planned spin-off of its Alcon eyecare unit, due for coming months, with investors with five Novartis shares due to receive one share of Alcon stock.Swiss shareholder group Actares said insurance systems are being ""taken hostage"" by high prices for life-saving drugs. It called out Novartis's $475,000 cancer cell therapy Kymriah and its still-unapproved gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy that Novartis contends is cost-effective at $4-$5 million per patient, while independent groups have concluded its value is less than that.Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who did not testify this week before the U.S. Senate with other global drug industry executives also facing criticism for drug prices, said he seeks to price medicines based on their value, adding Novartis needs a fair return to further research and development.""With respect to pricing in cell and gene therapies, I think what's often lost in the discussion is the remarkable impact of these medicines,"" Narasimhan said. ""These are true breakthroughs that come from a single infusion of a medicine that don't require lifelong therapy.""Actares President Veronika Hendry said high drug prices present society with difficult questions over access. ""With this business model you are taking hostage an insurance system that depends on solidarity,"" Hendry said.

"MILAN (Reuters) - Hitachi (T:6501) has wrapped up a bitter feud with U.S. activist investor Elliott over  Ansaldo STS  (MI:STS), agreeing to buy the fund's stake in the Italian rail signaling group as part of a move to take full control.The Japanese conglomerate could spend as much as 1.25 billion euros to become the sole owner of Ansaldo STS, which it said would have a leading role to play in growing its rail business, including through acquisitions. Hitachi and investment funds led by Elliott have been rowing since the Japanese company took a majority stake in Ansaldo STS in 2015, with Elliott - which holds a minority stake - complaining about the price paid by Hitachi as well as Ansaldo's strategy and governance.Under the deal announced on Monday, Hitachi will pay a premium of 9.5 percent to buy Elliott's 31.79 percent stake in Ansaldo STS, costing it around 807.6 million euros ($920 million). It will then launch a bid for the rest of Italian company with the aim of delisting it.Hitachi will buy Elliott's shares in Ansaldo STS at 12.70 euros. The mandatory bid on residual shares will then be launched at the same price.Ansaldo STS shares rose more than 9 percent to a session high of 12.68 euros, matching the offer price.Owned by U.S. hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Elliott is an outspoken investor in many European and U.S. companies. In 2015 Elliott refused to sell its Ansaldo STS shares to Hitachi in a previous public offer on the Italian company, judging the 9.50 euro per share price offered then too low.The railway industry was shaken last year when  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) announced a plan to merge their rail units into a Franco-German champion to stave off competition from bigger Chinese rival China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation and Canada's Bombardier Transportation.($1 = 0.8776 euros) ",1,1

"By Stine JacobsenCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk's (CO:MAERSKb) is betting on winning new customers for its port division by becoming a one-stop shop that can transport goods from factory to retailers' shelves.The move comes as Maersk, the world's biggest container shipper, is entering uncharted territory following its sale last year of most of its energy businesses. This marked a major shift of focus for the group towards transport and logistics.Last month, Maersk said it aimed to expand its port and transport services, giving customers the chance to deal with one company when shipping goods from factory to shop shelf.Maersk has said it aims to become a global integrator of container logistics and is looking to models similar to the courier express and package industry, where customers deal with just one company such as UPS (N:UPS) or FedEx (N:FDX). But Maersk has no plans to enter the courier and package business.As part of the expansion, APM Terminals, the group's port division, which operates 74 port facilities and handled nearly 40 million containers last year, will expand onshore services to cater to companies like railway operators and freight haulers. ""If we're going to optimise Maersk's entire end-to-end supply chain then of course we need to optimise one of the points that could otherwise be a bottleneck and that's the port,"" APM Terminal's chief commercial officer Henrik Lundgaard Pedersen said in an interview.Pedersen said customers were increasingly asking for add-on services at the port terminals, which are the effective ""nerve centre"" for transporting cargo around the world.He said customers' were looking to deal with ""fewer business partners to do the same or more types of services.""The new services include streamlining the process of weighing, stripping and filling the shipping containers and improving trucker appointment systems for delivery and pick-up.""In some parts of the world, truckers can wait hours outside our terminals,"" Pedersen said. The planning to reduce waiting time is becoming ""very, very critical,"" he said. As part of the plans, APM Terminals has set up landside facilities within customers' premises in Peru and Chile so it can take charge of a cargo before it even leaves the mine or plantation.""We go all the way into where they grow the grapes, then we help them get them into the right container and all the way through the port to your dining table,"" Pedersen said.In Mexico, for example, APM Terminals organizes train transport from the Pacific Coast to premises close to Mexico City.Maersk captured synergies worth $100 million last year from integrating its transport and logistics business and targets total synergies of $600 million by 2019.Pedersen declined to give details on what investments were expected, but said capital expenditure for handling equipment was ""much less"" than when taking cargo from ship to shore.APM Terminals is the second-biggest division after Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipper, and it accounted for around 13 percent of revenue last year.

"(Bloomberg) -- French and Italian leaders have reveled in throwing mud at each other, but two of the countries’ flagship companies are now looking beyond the bad blood to cozy up to each other.The prospective deal, a proposal by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) to merge with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), could create the world’s third-biggest carmaker. The prospect is already triggering contrasting responses from politicians, though the Italian company has said there won’t be plant closures as a result of the combination.On hearing news of the tie-up, the rightist League party of Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, who has in the past clashed virulently with French President Emmanuel Macron, swiftly invoked Italy’s “national interest” and dangled the option of the Rome government stepping in. The League, after all, campaigned for Sunday’s European Parliament election on an “Italy First” platform.“Given the state presence in Renault, the fact that two companies of this size plan to merge has to be looked at with special care,” the League’s Claudio Borghi, who heads the lower house budget committee, told La7 television. Borghi was quick to remind viewers that the French government fought tooth-and-nail against a bid by Italy’s Fincantieri for the France-based STX shipyard.Italy will ensure “that the historic value of Fiat is guaranteed, otherwise we’ll intervene,” Borghi said, adding that could include the state taking a stake in Fiat to match the French holding in Renault.Debt MountainA French government official said it would be surprising if the founding Agnelli family welcomed a state presence in the company. The official, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters, also wondered aloud whether the Italian government -- already burdened with a mountain of debt -- would have the funds to pay for it.Still, the official could not see any political risks to the merger, and insisted it would be a win-win for the two countries and their economies.The merger will promote European “economic sovereignty,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told BFM TV, adding the government favors the link-up, though it’s waiting to examine all the conditions.With the League surging to become Italy’s biggest political force in Sunday’s European elections, Salvini could be more tempted than ever to fly the nationalist flag and take a provocative stand on the merger, especially if jobs are at risk.“We welcome the FCA-Renault deal, as long as factories in Italy stay open,” the League’s Massimo Garavaglia, deputy finance minister, told Radio 24. “The market is always right.”Recent cross-border transactions have inflamed nationalism in both countries.  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA’s two biggest shareholders, French media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA and U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp., have been locked in a battle for influence at the carrier for more than a year.Salvini has taken particular pleasure in launching folksy broadsides against Macron, last year calling him “a polite young man who drinks too much champagne.” Salvini has also accused Macron of protecting fugitives wanted by Italian authorities, including convicted members of the far-left Red Brigades.Macron, who has spoken of “populist leprosy,” retorted that Italians “deserve a government worthy of their history.”The sparring between the two neighbors has quieted down from its low point, when France recalled its ambassador for a week in February, although Salvini repeatedly took aim at Macron in the European election campaign, calling the French leader a symbol of the liberal, establishment class he pledged to overthrow.",1,2
"By David Henry and Inti LandauroNEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Sunday that it has selected impoverished areas around Paris as the first foreign focus of an urban economic development strategy it started four years ago in Detroit.The bank will contribute $30 million over five years to programs to teach job skills and expand small businesses in Seine-Saint-Denis and other places with high unemployment and poverty, JPMorgan said in a statement provided to Reuters.Located north of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis has the highest poverty and crime rates in France. Dotted with large social housing projects, the area is separated from wealthy Paris only by an extremely congested highway circling the city. The area was in the center of the riots that devastated suburbs all over France a decade ago.CEO Jamie Dimon planned to follow the announcement with a visit to the city on Tuesday. Dimon has been leaving more day-to-day operations of the New York-based bank to lieutenants while he promotes policies and public-private partnerships which he believes will promote economic growth.His advocacy work has been primarily in the United States where JPMorgan earns about 80 percent of its revenue.The Paris effort is part of JPMorgan's ""Advancing Cities"" program, which builds on investments of $150 million in Detroit and $40 million in Chicago, cities where JPMorgan has the biggest market share of bank deposits.JPMorgan executives have said they want more business abroad, particularly commercial lending to mid-sized companies.JPMorgan employs about 200 people in France among some 255,000 worldwide.JPMorgan employees in Paris work in investment banking, money management and capital markets. They do not serve low-income individuals or small businesses who could be the first to benefit from the new effort.Peter Scher, JPMorgan Head of Corporate Responsibility, said the program will provide workers the skills needed by the bank's business clients, some of which are in office towers near areas where unemployment rates reach 35 percent.""That is a good bet for the economy and it is a good bet for our firm,"" said Scher.The job training will focus on the construction, information technology and environmental sustainability industries which are important in France, he said.The $30 million for Paris is part of $500 million JPMorgan said in September that it would spend in as many as 30 cities, including some outside of the United States.JPMorgan reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion.",1,1
"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - A surge of interest in Italian bond futures may be a sign of a substantial short position building up in the derivatives market as tensions rise over budget negotiations between Rome and Brussels.The big short in the futures market reflects a buildup in speculative and hedging activity after a tumultuous summer in the Italian markets and also indicates rising concerns of capital outflows.Investors say it also leaves the market potentially open to a sharp rebound if the debt story improves in some way over the coming months either through a breakthrough in negotiations over the debt dynamics or approval from credit rating agencies.As Italy's anti-establishment government attempts to pass an expansionary budget in the face of opposition from the European Union, investors are ramping up their use of a product that is increasingly being used to take bets that more losses are in store for the country's bonds.Italy has the biggest outstanding bond market in the euro zone and futures trading has rocketed in recent months as hedge funds have stepped up their presence, even as the underlying cash bond markets have shown signs of stress during extreme episodes of volatility.Average daily turnover so far this year for short-term BTP futures contracts have surged 40 percent to nearly 70,000 contracts compared to 2017 while longer-term BTP futures have also grown substantially, according to futures exchange, Eurex.The rise in turnover has also been accompanied by surging yields and growing open interest or the amount of positions left outstanding, indicating speculators are comfortable in taking outright short bets, according to market players.For example, open interest on short-dated BTP futures <0#FBTS:> peaked at a record 280,000 contracts on Oct. 25 and has consistently averaged around 275,000 contracts in the last two weeks.""Clearly today there are a number of investors, including large hedge fund investors who are taking large short positions on Italian debt through both the short and long-dated BTP futures,"" said Mark Dowding, head of developed markets at BlueBay Asset Management.In contrast to the growing popularity of bond futures, turnover in credit default swaps has declined as the increased scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the euro zone crisis dimmed its allure for taking speculative bets.For example, net outstanding dollar value of credit default swaps (CDS) contracts on Italy has declined by more than a quarter to less than $12 billion in the week ending November 6, compared to the beginning of 2017, according to data from post-trade provider Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.""In a world where investors can't take naked short positions by buying sovereign CDS, Italian futures are the instrument to use if you want to implement a short view,"" Dowding added. GRAPHIC: Spike in open interest in 2-yr BTP Futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P2MCh1TAKING BETSA portfolio manager at a macro-hedge fund in London said he uses futures to take bets on Italian debt because the margining system in futures contracts makes it less capital intensive than purchasing bonds.Margining refers to the practice in futures markets, wherein investors have to cough up only a chunk of the notional value contract, allowing them to take bigger positions. In cash or CDS trading, on the other hand, traders have to put up the entire amount in order to take a view.Despite more capital needed to trade credit default swaps compared to futures, these derivatives, designed to protect against the risk of debt default, were widely used by investors looking to hedge the possibility of sovereign default, especially in Greece, during the 2010-2012 debt crisis.CDS were used also to take directional bets on a market, sometimes even when the investor did not own the bond prompting regulators to bring in rules banning ""naked"" CDS trading -- purchasing CDS contracts in a purely speculative manner without having exposure to the underlying asset.The increased scrutiny on CDS trading by regulators fueled appetite for trading bond futures as investors welcomed their transparent settlement mechanisms and liquidity, particularly during times of market stress. So this year, when a severe Italian bond selloff kicked off in May, futures trading exploded where open interest has increased every month barring May, June and September this year. Seamus MacGorain, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, said futures trading activity also tends to spike during periods of volatility because that is usually accompanied by across-the-board liquidity declines.Decline in liquidity is evident from widening bid-offer spreads -- the difference between prices what investors pay to execute a trade with wider spreads indicating falling liquidity.In September for instance, monthly weighted average bid-offer spreads on five-year bonds stood at a chunky 13 basis points, the Italian Treasury's website says.Those spreads were a fraction in the futures markets, according to a bond trader. ""Italian bond market liquidity fell during summer's market volatility, and continues to be impaired,"" MacGorain said.GRAPHIC: Italian bond yield - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qw6pSy ",1,2

"Investing.com -- Shares in Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) fell in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday after the cloud security company backed a conservative full-year billings outlook that overshadowed better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results.Calculated billings for the California-based firm's 2024 financial year were reaffirmed at a range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion, disappointing Bloomberg consensus projections of $2.55B at the midpoint.Observers had hoped that Zscaler's decision to raise its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of?$2.45 to $2.48 from a prior outlook of $2.20 to $2.25 would also translate to an improved billings guidance, analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients.Speaking to analysts in a call, Zscaler Chief Financial Officer Remo Canessa flagged that the global operating environment remains ""challenging,"" adding that customers are ""continu[ing] to scrutinize large deals."" However, consumer sentiment ""seems to be stabilizing,"" according to Canessa.""In our outlook for fiscal [year 2024], we are balancing our business optimism and continued sales execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties,"" he said.Executives at Zscaler noted that the fresh appointment of a go-to-market leadership team that aims to ""scale and accelerate"" the company's next phase of expansion was also cited as a motive for the muted billings estimate.In Zscaler's first quarter, calculated billings grew 34% year-over-year to $456.6M, although that was slower than a 37% increase seen in the prior three-month period.?Meanwhile, for?the quarter ended on Oct. 31, Zscaler reported adjusted per-share income?of $0.67 on revenue of $496.7M. The figures topped estimates despite an almost 24% jump in quarterly operating expenses to $431.4M, which reflected a push to roll out new services to satisfy surging demand for cyber security and artificial intelligence offerings.“In order to meet this growing need, we are scaling our go-to-market and [research and development] organizations, strengthening our foundation for the long-term growth of our business,” said Chief Executive Officer Jay Chaudhry in a statement.Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.",0,0
"By Yasin Ebrahim?Investing.com ? Wall Street fell on Tuesday, as a plunge in oil prices weighed on investor sentiment, even as Congress readies a $500 billion coronavirus aid package to further support the economy. ?The Dow fell 2.67%, or 631 points, theS&P 500 slipped 3,07% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.48%.Worries over a storage squeeze amid a collapsed in fuel demand sent oil prices sharply lower for the second day in a row.""The EIA reported in October that storage capacity was around 426.5 (million barrels) and was 55% full.

"Investing.com ? Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow1. Inflation on Watch as Analysts Say Rate Cuts Coming Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in July rose 0.3% from 0.1% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% from a 0.3% gain in June.That would bring year-over-year core CPI growth to 3.2% and core CPI growth unchanged at 2.1%.The Federal Reserve pointed to the subdued pace of consumer inflation as one of the key reasons for its rate cut last month, and further evidence of sluggish prices will strengthen calls for more aggressive rate cuts. UBS said it expected the Fed to deliver two further cuts, in September and in December this year, with another cut in March 2020, reducing rates to a range of 1% to 1.25%, well below the Fed's recent outlook on the longer-run fed funds rate of 2.5%Expectations for rate cuts as well as weakening global growth saw the Treasury curve flatten further on Monday, with the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 2-year Treasuries narrowing to levels not seen since 2007.2. API Crude Inventories, OPEC Monthly Report in Spotlight Following the Energy Information Administration's report last week of an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, investors will look to the American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data for further insight into domestic crude supplies. The report will arrive ahead of OPEC's monthly report, with investors keen to get a sense of the oil cartel's outlook on world demand and supply.The monthly report comes at a time when many fear a slowdown in the global economy could dent oil demand and pressure crude prices further. West Texas Intermediate crude is off about 17% from its late April peak of $66.30.Crude oil prices, however, shrugged off fears of a slowdown in global growth on Monday, settling at $54.93 a barrel, up 0.8%, supported by reports that OPEC, in particular Saudi Arabia, is eyeing further production cuts. 3. JD.com, Tilray Earnings on DeckJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell, with shares up about 29% so far this year. The company's efforts to increase its e-commerce footprint in emerging markets is expected to continue underpin top-line growth. The company previously guided second-quarter revenue in the range of RMB145 billion and RMB150 billion, representing growth of 19% to 23% year on year.JD.com is expected to report earnings per share of RMB0.46 on RMB147.56 billion of revenue, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), meanwhile, kicks off earnings for marijuana stocks after the closing bell. Like some of its peers, Tilray's earnings have been characterized by surging revenue, but widening losses as the marijuana company continues to invest in expanding its production and manufacturing operations in Canada and Portugal. The marijuana producer's acquisition of Manitoba Harvest in February earlier is expected to boost recreational cannabis sales and hemp food sales.

"By Arunima Banerjee(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he was selling auto parts maker Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Inc (N:TEN) in a $5.4 billion deal, unloading an investment he has held for nearly two decades and picking up a new stake in Tenneco.Tenneco plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies - one focusing on powertrain products and the other on auto parts such as suspensions and axle dampers - after the deal closes.The new bulked up powertrain technology company will likely benefit from the fact that internal combustion engine parts and tailpipe exhaust scrubbing technology will be needed by automakers for a long time to come, before they can be replaced by newer technologies such as fully electric cars.The aftermarket parts company would provide a potentially steady cash flow.This is the latest in a series of corporate restructurings or spinoffs in the auto supplier industry, as investors press for more focused companies. See Breakingviews: B. Riley analyst Christopher Van Horn said the Federal-Mogul deal could drive expectations of more consolidation in the sector.Tenneco's shares rose 5.8 percent to $58.78, while Icahn Enterprises' (O:IEP) shares were up 2.7 percent at $61.29.""Going to market with well-recognized brands, more product categories, greater coverage and expanded distribution capabilities is a strong formula for capturing growth, particularly in China,"" Tenneco Executive Chairman Gregg Sherrill said on the call. Icahn Enterprises  will get $800 million cash and 29.5 million of Tenneco common shares in the deal.The equity value of the deal is $2.4 billion. Federal-Mogul, which makes powertrain parts including pistons, ignition coils and spark plugs, had gross debt of $3.1 billion.It was not clear if Icahn would hold stakes in the separate companies.He first bought convertible bonds in Federal-Mogul in 2001 for $1.1 billion, and finally took it private last year after buying the remaining 18 percent he did not already own.Icahn's firm Icahn Enterprises (O:IEP) typically buys undervalued assets, improves their operations, and ultimately sells them at a profit.""We expect to be meaningful stockholders of Tenneco going forward,"" Icahn said in a statement.The deal is expected to generate $200 million in annual earnings and $250 million in working capital.Lake Forest, Illinois-based Tenneco, whose customers include  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), would now also get  Cummins Inc  (N:CMI) and luxury carmaker Jaguar as clients. Barclays  (LON:BARC) was the lead financial adviser to Tenneco, while J.P.Morgan was the M&A adviser. ",1,2
"(Bloomberg) -- At this point, it’s more likely a matter of when -- not if -- the 10-year Treasury yield hits 3 percent. And that apparent inevitability raises a pressing question: How to trade when it happens?The 10-year yield was last above 3 percent in January 2014 and since the start of last year bond gurus like Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital and Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners have highlighted the level as critical to determining whether the three-decade bull market in bonds is at an end. It’s also seen as the point at which equity markets might crack and the dollar could halt its slump against other major currencies.The yield reached as high as 2.9537 percent on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting helped spur a selloff, and it was at 2.93 percent as of 7:45 a.m. Thursday in New York.Here’s what to watch for when the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reaches the much vaunted 3 percent level:Breakout or Pullback?The most immediate question for traders: Do 10-year yields hit 3 percent and retreat, or does positioning signal a sharp move higher? Anticipating the volatility and its implications could make a big difference.“Certainly as we get closer to 3 percent, people will get nervous,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “I would expect flows to pick up as we’re closer and closer to 3 and to see some choppiness in the market.”Volatility may not be as bad as some investors fear. So-called “short gamma” strategies, which effectively bet that the market will stay quiet, have been steadily hedging those wagers, according to a New York trader who isn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. That means an accelerated break through 3 percent may not happen.In fact, open interest on 10-year Treasury futures suggests 3 percent may not be the crucial level after all. There are a large number of March puts at a 120 strike price, equivalent to a 2.95 percent yield. That helps explain the resistance to moving much higher than that so far this year.Another large accumulation of puts comes at a 118 strike price in April, equivalent to a 3.1 percent yield on the 10-year security. Dealers who are on the other side of those options could hedge during a selloff by purchasing 10-year Treasury futures, thus creating inherent support.In other words, those bond bears ready to watch the Treasury market falter at 3 percent may be in for a slow grind.Testing TechnicalsTo be precise, traders will be watching for the 10-year yield to break through 3.0516 percent, the intraday high from Jan. 2, 2014. You have to go back to July 2011 to find the last time the yield exceeded that level.Technical analysis has its naysayers, but it’s been a harbinger of things to come since Donald Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential election. For all of 2017, the key 2.64 percent level on 10-year yields couldn’t be broken. Strategists warned that a breach left little stopping an ascent to 3 percent.Sure enough, yields soared past 2.64 percent in January and now they’re knocking on the door of 3 percent.The next stop (once 3 percent is convincingly in the rear-view mirror) is less clear. Beyond 3.05 percent, the next area of yield resistance would be around 3.14 percent or 3.15 percent, which relates to levels from late 2010 and early 2011, said Marty Mitchell, a former head government-bond trader at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and now an independent strategist. Further out, he points to 3.215 percent to 3.25 percent.In the distance, a big key level would be near the highs for 2011, Mitchell said. The yield reached as much as 3.77 percent in February of that year. Of course, that’s a ways away and, as the positioning data shows, it’ll be a struggle to take out each successive key level.“I think we test 3.05, then we see a more sustained correction downside in yields,” Mitchell said. “But I believe we’re in an uptrend in yields, so any strength in the bond market needs to be sold.”Watching StocksTreasuries, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s easy to forget amid 2018’s rout that the 10-year yield plunged almost 14 basis points on Feb. 5, capitalizing on haven demand as equities suffered steep losses. When stocks stabilized, yields marched higher again.Some strategists say a 3 percent 10-year yield represents the end of the stock market rally, with corporate borrowing costs becoming too punitive and fixed-income looking too appealing. Others, like Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, say 3.5 percent is the level to watch.Regardless of the exact level, bond traders may find that the best barometer of which way yields are headed after 3 percent will come from stocks. A bout of selling in equities probably means the “tug-of-war” between the two asset classes is alive and well, serving as a cap on yields and perhaps preventing too much tightening from the Federal Reserve. If stocks shrug at 3 percent, then it’s a green light for the selloff to carry on. Hedge funds and other large speculators have a lot riding on the outcome. The group has boosted short bets in 10-year Treasury futures to a record, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through Feb. 13. That positioning could exacerbate the market moves in either direction.Long-Run DivergenceLost in the question of “what’s next” is that 3 percent marks the highest yield on a 10-year Treasury note in more than four years. That’s a compelling proposition, particularly for hold-until-maturity investors, who are relatively insensitive to price swings.It’s tempting to wait for an even better entry point. But more than half of the 59 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg this month say the 10-year yield will end 2018 at or below 3 percent. After all, the Fed’s own projections call for its target rate to climb just above 3 percent in 2020, before settling at a longer-term rate of 2.75 percent.“If you think that 3 percent is where the Fed is going to stay, you’ll see a significant level of demand at those levels,” said Bruno Braizinha, a rates and cross-asset strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.His fellow strategists at Wall Street banks are finally seeing signs that the overwhelmingly bearish momentum is starting to fade.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., for instance, is looking to go long if yields keep climbing.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc isn’t waiting for 3 percent, instead recommending buying at 2.9 percent.Then there are those in the middle, like Cloherty at RBC. A 3 percent 10-year yield could serve as a good short-term trade, he said, because Japanese investors are likely to step in and buy after their fiscal year ends on March 31. But it’s probably headed higher toward the end of 2018.“The pattern will be a sideways slide for the second quarter and then we leak higher in the second half on Fed tightening and an awful lot of Treasury supply,” Cloherty said. “We see people trying to protect themselves more against higher rates, but I don’t think that just because we break 3 we’re destined to go to 3.5.”(Updates to add yields in third paragraph.)",1,2

"By Lawrence WhiteLONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) plans to invest heavily in its newly combined retail and private banking business as it targets internationally minded customers in markets such as China, the United States and Singapore, the unit's Chief Executive Charlie Nunn told Reuters.Nunn, a former McKinsey consultant who joined HSBC (HK:0005) in 2011, was one of the biggest winners in the banking group's latest management reshuffle, taking control of a division with $1.4 trillion in clients' assets.The plan is to grow in the three major markets where HSBC has scale, namely Britain, Hong Kong and Mexico, focusing on mortgages, wealth and insurance products, and unsecured lending respectively.HSBC will also target wealthier customers who travel or invest often overseas in more than 10 markets such as China where its share is smaller, Nunn said. He was speaking to Reuters in the first interview by a senior HSBC executive since the bank announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs and restructure.""We're in some of the fastest-growing wealth markets in the world... the fact we now have a $1.4 trillion wealth business should be exciting for our customers and hopefully scary for our competitors,"" Nunn said.Nunn is already making management changes. HSBC named Kevin Martin, head of Asia Pacific retail banking and wealth management, as the chief operating officer of the new global wealth and personal banking business, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wealth and personal banking division combined two of HSBC's better-performing businesses in 2019, growing adjusted profits by 19% and 15% respectively.CHINESE DIASPORAAs part of its Asia expansion HSBC has hired some 800 frontline and support staff in wealth management since 2017, Nunn said, mainly product specialists and relationship managers for its private bank and 'Jade' offering for those with assets of $1 million-$5 million. ""We remain committed to really trying to capture share and be more relevant in the Greater Bay area of China,"" Nunn said.In an example of how the lender is targeting the global Chinese diaspora, HSBC has launched an international payment system allowing mainland Chinese customers to pay university fees directly, in renminbi, across 1,700 institutions worldwide.HSBC interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn said on Tuesday the bank is combining wealth and personal banking so it can boost profits from the transfer of products and investment between the two.HSBC will aim to expand a partnership with the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), to use its Aladdin investment management software in more markets.The bank will also extend its Lombard lending product which allows customers to borrow against assets they hold with the bank, for example to buy property for a family member.TOUGH COMPETITIONHSBC will face a tough challenge in its target markets, however, with domestic players dominating retail banking in the United States and China and global giants such as UBS (S:UBSG) ruling the market for wealthier clients.While HSBC's British and Hong Kong retail banking businesses have powered its profits in recent years, in other markets such as France its sub-scale high street banking presence has been a drag on earnings.The lender is attempting to sell that business, Reuters has previously reported. Nunn declined to comment on the progress of that strategic review but said a decision will be made in 1-2 months.He also declined to comment on other markets such as Turkey, Greece and Oman, previously reported by Reuters as earmarked for exit.""We'll continue to review markets on a case-by-case basis,"" Nunn said.

"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers and parts suppliers on Thursday warned that President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened car tariffs would undermine the benefits of the new deal to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, causing widespread job losses.At a wide-ranging hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission, labor representatives said the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) fails to include adequate enforcement of labor standards, while Southeastern U.S. fruit and vegetable growers said it leaves them vulnerable to subsidized Mexican competition.The testimony will feed into a study by the commission on the economic impact of the trade deal reached on Sept. 30, which could heavily influence support for it in the U.S. Congress. A vote on the pact is not expected until the spring of 2019, following a lengthy consultation process.Several automotive trade groups said side letters to the USMCA deal that allow Canada and Mexico duty-free auto import quotas in the event that Trump imposes car tariffs was an indication that such a move seemed inevitable.The Trump administration is considering recommendations from the Commerce Department on whether to impose tariffs on national security grounds under Section 232 of a Cold War-era trade law.No decisions have been made, but President Donald Trump has frequently threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on autos and parts to pressure the European Union and Japan to make trade concessions.""If implemented, increased auto tariffs would not only undermine the potential success of the USMCA, they would also pose a material threat to the economy and may result in the loss of as many as 700,000 jobs across the U.S.,"" said Jennifer Thomas, vice president of government affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.The groups also said the failure of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to lift steel and aluminum tariffs have cost the industry billions of dollars and trade turmoil in general has paralyzed investment decisions.""The current state of play on trade has placed our industry in turmoil,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. ""In the last year our members have faced Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, other Section 232 tariffs proposed, and Section 301 tariffs on goods from China.""DETROIT VS FOREIGN BRANDSThere also was a divergence of views among domestic and foreign automakers on the overall benefits of the USMCA agreement, which requires autos to have 75 percent regional content and at least 40 percent from the United States or Canada.John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers which represents foreign brand automakers with U.S. plants, said he was concerned that the ""many layered"" content requirements would hurt automakers' competitiveness by requiring ""unnecessary"" supply chain shifts and investment in compliance.Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Fiat Chrysler, described the trade deal as ""workable"" for these companies which have larger U.S. manufacturing footprints than their competitors.He said it would not require massive manufacturing and supply chain changes immediately but over time, automakers would need to consider changes in where they build cars and major components.CORN VS TOMATOESA similar divergence came from agriculture groups, where grain farmers and shippers said it was a ""significant advancement"" that expands market access but seasonal produce groups said it fails to address Mexican subsidies that are driving Southeastern growers out of business.An initial U.S. demand for the ability to impose seasonal tariffs to protect U.S. fruit and vegetable growers was abandoned during the 13-month negotiations.""We have gotten the short end of the stick since the ink dried on the agreement,"" said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.AFL-CIO trade policy specialist Celeste Drake said that the enforcement mechanism for new, higher labor standards was weak, relying on a seldom used state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism.""We urge the commission to make clear that if the obligations are not enforced, the lure of cheap and easy labor exploitation in Mexico will continue to draw production and hold down wages in both countries,"" she said.

"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) forecast another year of growth in 2020, saying the company was well-placed to take advantage of increased defence spending that could help to offset any future impact from a German ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia.Full-year results announced on Thursday at the upper end of forecasts, helped to drive shares 3.5% higher at 664.6 pence by 0954 GMT.The maker of Typhoon fighters, combat vehicles and Astute Class nuclear-powered attack submarines, has been affected by a German ban announced in 2019 on exporting arms to Saudi Arabia.The export ban has put a question mark over a multi-billion pound deal to sell 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Riyadh, built by a BAE-led consortium that also includes MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Airbus (PA:AIR).CEO Charles Woodburn shrugged off its impact, saying there were other opportunities.""A number of European countries are looking to increase their defence spending and move closer to meeting their NATO commitments. The group is well-positioned to benefit,"" he told reporters on Thursday.The company expects Germany to order more of its Typhoon jets, anticipates higher sales at European missile maker MBDA, in which it owns a stake, and new orders for its Swedish-based land vehicle business.Woodburn also predicted business in the Middle East, despite the difficulties in Saudi Arabia.""Within the Middle East region, there are a number of other customers in addition to Saudi, who I think in future will be looking at additional Typhoons,"" he said. Oman, Kuwait and Qatar are existing customers.The Typhoon, whose full name is the Eurofighter Typhoon, is the most important combat aircraft in BAE Systems' portfolio.'RENEWED LIFE'BAE said its earnings per share would grow by a mid-single digit percentage next year. The group also said on Thursday it would make a 1 billion pound ($1.29 billion) one-off payment into its pension scheme in the coming months, funded by debt.Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said he was encouraged the company had addressed its pension deficit.""We figure there is certainly renewed life at BAE,"" he said.BAE's earnings per share were 45.8 pence for 2019, at the upper end of a forecast for a mid-single digit rise on 2018's 42.9 pence, helped by an improved operational performance, after a focus on boosting performance in its U.S. combat vehicle unit, and a slightly lower tax rate.BAE's results this year could exceed forecasts, as they exclude any boost from two U.S. acquisitions totalling $2.2 billion, which it announced in January and which should be completed this year.",1,1

"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the richest people in the U.S. are calling for a federal wealth tax.Financier George Soros, heiresses Liesel and Regan Pritzker, Abigail  Disney  and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). co-founder Chris Hughes are among those calling for the levy to help address income inequality and provide funding to address climate change and public health issues.“We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans -- on us,” according to a letter signed by 19 individuals -- one anonymously -- and posted online Monday. “The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans.”Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke support the idea, according to the letter. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on assets of $50 million or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1 billion. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.Read more: Sanders to propose taxing Wall Street to pay off student debtsThe wealth tax isn’t embraced by all Democrats because many believe it would be difficult to assess objectively the value of wealth like artwork and jewels. There are also concerns that such a tax is unconstitutional because the federal government is prohibited from taxing property, only income.The New York Times reported on the letter earlier Monday.Some of those signing have already expressed concerns about America’s rising inequality. Hughes has evangelized for higher taxes on the rich in his book “Fair Shot.” Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co., recently called Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”Another signatory, entrepreneur Nick Hanauer, first warned his “fellow zillionaires” about the country’s growing wealth divide in 2014, writing that “there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out.”Such inequality has only deepened. Last week, Bernard Arnault joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as the third person with a fortune of at least $100 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, whose 500 members have a total net worth of $5.5 trillion, up from $4.9 trillion two years ago.(Updates with additional comments starting in seventh paragraph.)",1,2

"By Lawrence DelevingneNEW YORK (Reuters) - Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC rode bets on Asian stocks and U.S. corporate mergers to strong returns in 2017 - its best showing in years - but remained challenged by succession planning, declining assets and a stagnant stock price. Its flagship hedge fund, the OZ Master Fund Ltd, gained an estimated 10.4 percent net of fees in 2017, according to a letter sent to investors this week seen by Reuters. That was better than its historical average of 8.86 percent, its highest return since 2013, and above the benchmark HFRI asset-weighted composite gain of 6.52 percent.The performance, according to the letter, was driven by Asian shares such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Inc, JD.com Inc and Nintendo Co (T:7974), and mergers and acquisitions like pharmaceuticals business Actelion Ltd, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in June, and Aetna (NYSE:AET) Inc's proposed merger with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). The New York hedge fund firm, which goes by ""Oz Management,"" also made money on U.S. corporate and structured credit and lost on U.S. stocks and convertible and derivative arbitrage, the letter said.A spokesman for Oz declined to comment. The strong performance comes amid a stalled succession plan for Daniel Och, the firm's billionaire founder and chief executive officer. Oz sent a letter to investors on Dec. 23 saying that it was ""not the right time"" to promote co-Chief Investment Officer James ""Jimmy"" Levin to CEO. It added that Och and the firm's board of directors hoped that the 34-year-old Levin, Och's longtime prot?g? and heir apparent, would remain as co-CIO. David Windreich is the other co-CIO.The December letter was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. The Oz communication to clients this week added that ""we hope to come back to you in the near future to present the (succession) plan.""Och, through a spokesman, and Levin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One of the few publicly traded hedge fund managers, Oz's stock price and assets have also not rebounded alongside its performance. Shares have languished around $4 or below since early 2016 and fell to $2.37 on Friday from around $3.20 a year ago. The issue is not new: Oz went public in November 2007 at $32 a share. The firm managed $31.9 billion as of Jan. 1, according to the new letter, down from $47.5 billion at the end of 2014 and $37.9 billion at the end of 2016, according to public filings.  ",1,2

"By Jeffrey Heller and Tova CohenJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police alleged on Tuesday that Benjamin Netanyahu's former spokesman tried to bribe a judge to drop a fraud case against Netanyahu's wife, the latest corruption investigation encircling the long-serving prime minister.The new bribery case was one of two revealed on Tuesday involving the same former spokesman, a close Netanyahu confidant. Police also named him as someone they had arrested two days earlier in a separate case involving allegations of corruption at Israel's biggest telecoms company.The rightwing leader, in office for 12 years since 1996, has seen his dominance of Israeli politics threatened by corruption investigations since police recommended a week ago that he be indicted for bribery and fraud.He has denied wrongdoing in what are now four separate investigations, including two in which he is personally a suspect. He says the allegations are a political ""witch hunt"".In the latest case, police said former Netanyahu spokesman Nir Hefetz had offered through an intermediary in 2015 to help a judge win the post of attorney-general if she agreed to use the position to block any proceedings against Netanyahu's wife Sara.Last September Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said he was considering indicting Sara Netanyahu for fraud over suspected use of state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. She has denied the allegations and a final decision on charges is pending.""HALLUCINATORY""The prime minister rejected the allegation about the attempt to bribe the judge, calling it ""hallucinatory"".""I never approached Nir Hefetz about this, he never proposed to me anything about it, and you know what? I do not believe he raised the possibility with anyone,"" Netanyahu said.A lawyer for Hefetz could not be reached.In the other case revealed on Tuesday, police said they had arrested Hefetz and another Netanyahu confidant, Shlomo Filber, who once ran the Communications Ministry, over allegations of corruption involving the telecoms firm Bezeq. (TA:BEZQ)Bezeq's main shareholder, Shaul Elovitch, was also arrested, along with his wife and son, and Bezeq's CEO Stella Handler. Elovitch is a family friend of the Netanyahus. The arrests took place on Sunday but were not disclosed for two days under standard Israeli procedure.Police suspect Bezeq received regulatory benefits in return for providing favorable media coverage of Netanyahu on Walla, a news website that is controlled by Elovitch's holding company Eurocom.Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing, as have his wife and son, and Bezeq CEO Handler, a Eurocom spokeswoman said. Filber's lawyer declined to comment.Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case but Israeli media said he was likely to be questioned soon.Last week, police recommended Netanyahu be indicted in two cases. In one he is suspected of bribery over his acknowledged receipt of gifts from wealthy businessmen, which police say were worth nearly $300,000. In the other, he is alleged to have offered the publisher of Israel's biggest daily to curtail circulation of a rival newspaper in return for positive coverage.Netanyahu, who has maintained his normal working schedule and is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on March 5, has denied all the allegations and vowed to remain in office to serve out his term, which runs until 2019.Mandelblit is weighing indictments in those investigations, with a decision possibly months away.

"By Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) beat Microsoft in the battle for the U.S. arm of TikTok with a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale to try to navigate geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, people familiar with the matter said.ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or a consortium led by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.While TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials are concerned user information could be passed to China's communist government. TikTok, which has as many as 100 million U.S. users, has said it would never share such data with Chinese authorities.Sale negotiations were upended when China updated its export control rules last month, giving it a say over the transfer of TikTok's algorithm to a foreign buyer. Reuters reported last week that China would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than allow a forced sale.On Monday, China's state-run English television channel CGTN cited sources as saying ByteDance would not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Oracle or Microsoft, and would not give the source code for the platform to any U.S. firm.Under ByteDance's latest proposal, Oracle would be the firm's technology partner and assume management of TikTok's U.S. user data, sources told Reuters on Sunday. Oracle is also negotiating taking a stake in TikTok's U.S. operations, they said.The data is currently stored in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's cloud.Some of ByteDance's top investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, will also be given minority stakes in those operations, one of the people said.PRECEDENTIt is unclear whether Trump, who wants a U.S. technology firm to own most of TikTok in the United States, will approve the deal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for national security risk, is overseeing the ByteDance-Oracle talks.""User data protection and assurances around how the company's algorithms push content to U.S. users are thoughtful components of a substantive solution, but whether they can change political outcomes is a much more difficult question,"" said regulatory lawyer John Kabealo, who is not involved in the talks.ByteDance plans to argue that CFIUS' approval two years ago of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's [OWREAC.UL] purchase of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc (NYSE:GNW) offers a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, the sources said.In that deal, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based, third-party service to manage Genworth's U.S. policyholder data. ByteDance will argue a similar arrangement with Oracle can safeguard TikTok's U.S. user data, the sources said.ByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment on Monday when asked at a press conference about the TikTok deal, but said TikTok was being ""encircled"" and ""coerced"" in the United States into a transaction. ""We urge the U.S. government to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for foreign firms operating and investing in the United States,"" he said. WALMART BLOWOracle's chairman Larry Ellison is one of the tech world's few Trump supporters. His firm has significant technological prowess in handling and safeguarding data, but no social media experience as its clientele comprises companies, rather than consumers.Peking University professor of investment Jeffrey Towson said Oracle's ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations with access, but not ownership, of ByteDance's core technology mirrored how many Western companies operate in China.Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok's U.S. operations. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which had joined Microsoft's bid, said it was still interested in investing, and that it would talk further with ByteDance and other parties.""This is bad news for Walmart more than anyone else,"" said Towson. ""Combining TikTok's entertainment and user engagement with its e-commerce platform was its best shot at catching up"" with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).TRUMP'S ORDERSAs Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cybersecurity and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint.Trump signed two executive orders last month targeting TikTok and ByteDance. The first, effective Sept. 20, bans U.S. companies from transacting with them. The second requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Nov. 12.Were Trump to agree to ByteDance's proposed Oracle deal, he would have to rescind his order calling specifically for divestment.As many as 40% of Americans back Trump's threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump's party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.'UNTRUSTED' APPSThe White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's messenger app WeChat.Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok. ",1,2
"By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court was hearing on Tuesday whether a plumber hired on a self-employed basis should have received workers' rights, in a case which could affect the business models of major firms operating in the gig economy.Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL], car service Addison Lee and takeaway food courier Deliveroo are among those who hire their drivers as self-employed, entitling them only to basic protections such as health and safety.Workers receive the minimum wage, holiday pay and rest breaks, prompting unions to take legal action to end what they say are exploitative practices in the gig economy, where people tend to work for several firms without fixed contracts.Uber and other companies have defended their business models saying their drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and on average earn more than the minimum wage, but have lost a series of court cases on the issue. Tuesday's case involves Gary Smith who worked for the firm Pimlico Plumbers between 2005 and 2011 and took the company to an employment tribunal after being dismissed.A tribunal judge said the firm imposed restrictions on the work Smith could do and that he was obliged to perform a certain number of minimum hours on agreed days, meaning he should be considered a worker. Pimlico Plumbers has said that Smith's pay was ""extremely good"", allowing him to take care of his own holiday and sickness pay and that he fully understood his employment status. The firm unsuccessfully appealed the original decision at the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal, with the case now reaching the Supreme Court.Britain's top judges will hear the case on Tuesday and Wednesday and are expected to make a decision within three to six months, which would apply to everyone working on a self-employed basis in the same way across thousands of firms, according to a court spokesman.The government has faced increasing pressure from lawmakers and unions on how to handle modern working practices in recent months and launched a consultation after a review said many people at the biggest firms deserved more rights.

"By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Roku tumbled 7% on Friday after the streaming video company told customers it was removing Fox channels from its platform ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl broadcast.""On January 31, 2020, all standalone FOX channels will no longer be available on Roku streaming devices,"" Roku wrote in an email to customers on Thursday. It added that its viewers could watch Fox channels on other companies' services, including Hulu and Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) YouTube.Shares of  Fox Corp  (O:FOXA), which is broadcasting the National Football League championship game between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, fell about 1%.The removal of Fox from its platform is related to the Jan. 31 expiration of an agreement between the two companies.""Roku's tactics are a poorly timed negotiating ploy, fabricating a crisis with no thought for the alarm it generated among its own customers,"" Fox said in a statement sent to Reuters.Roku did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Carriage disputes between networks and cable providers in the past have led to viewers losing the ability to watch channels. Last July, millions of DirecTV subscribers temporarily lost access to CBS programming in over a dozen cities.While viewership has declined in recent years, the Super Bowl remains the single most watched U.S. event of the year, making it a potentially high-value pawn in contract negotiations.Riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over the consumer shift from cable television to streaming, Roku's stock has surged almost 800% since its initial public offering in 2017. Friday's sell-off reduces Roku's 12-month return to 172% and leaves it at a level last seen in November.",0,0

"By Elizabeth DiltsNEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) lowered its outlook for 2019 net interest income by about $500 million on Tuesday, following similar moves by rival big banks  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).""Our (net interest income) will be a little bit lower than we told you last time,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said at Barclays' Financial Services Conference in New York. ""I think we told you $57.5 (billion) and I'm closer to $57 (billion) for this year.""That is a lower forecast for full-year net interest income than the bank gave in mid-July and it shows that banks with large pools of customer deposits are struggling to make as much money amid lower interest rates and an inverted yield curve.On Monday, top brass from Citi and Wells Fargo tempered their outlooks for net interest income. Citi now expects net interest income to be up 3% to 4% for the year, compared with prior guidance of 4% growth.Wells Fargo lowered its projections for the second time this year. The bank's chief financial officer said it expects net interest income to fall 6% in 2019, compared with 5% stated previously.Dimon also said JPMorgan Chase expects third-quarter trading revenues to be 10% lower than in the second quarter, while fees from mergers and acquisitions will likely be flat in comparison with the prior quarter.

"?SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Blizzard Entertainment has reduced the punishment that it dealt out to a Hong Kong-based Hearthstone esports player for his public support of pro-democracy protests in the city, after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public.The U.S. games publisher, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), said last week that it would suspend the player Chung ""blitzchung"" Ng Wai from competition for a year and strip him of prize money after he called for the liberation of Hong Kong in a post-game interview.The decision made the company the latest corporate name to get caught up in tensions relating to the Hong Kong protests, garnering it support in China but also drawing criticism from fans, players and commentators in the West, some of whom said that they would stop working with Blizzard as a result of its decision.However on Saturday, Blizzard said it had decided to cut his punishment to a six month suspension and would still award him his prize money, with its president J. Allen Brack saying the company had ""reacted too quickly"" in making its decision.Brack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules, but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision.""I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,"" he said in a post on Blizzard's website.Chung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard's decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in the future, but urged the company to reconsider its decision to penalize two commentators at the tournament where he had made his remarks.The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests.Last week, the NBA became the target of a fierce backlash in China after one of its team managers posted a now-deleted tweet that expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters, which Chinese state media characterized as the latest example of meddling in China’s own affairs.",1,2

"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the additional funding Congress is poised to approve Thursday to help small businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic should be the last round, but advocates fear it’ll run out quickly and won’t be enough for mom-and-pop shops struggling to stay open.The U.S. House is expected to pass a bill Thursday afternoon including $320 billion more for a loan program to keep workers on payrolls. The program, which was launched by the Small Business Administration April 3 with $349 billion, ran out after just 13 days. Lawmakers are also adding $60 billion for a separate disaster loan and grant program whose coronavirus-related funding was exhausted last week.Mnuchin said this week he expects this would be the last round of funding because there are now other financing opportunities for small businesses, including more money for the disaster loans and the Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending facility.But small business advocates have estimated that as much as $1 trillion could be needed. They say as large banks are ready to flood the SBA with hundreds of thousands of applications totaling tens of billions of dollars, the additional money could be gone in a few days -- and it’s not clear how many small firms, especially those that haven’t applied yet, can get funding.“This next tranche is not going to be enough, obviously,” said Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. “There’s only so much in the funding pot that is available, and the smallest of small businesses unfortunately are not getting access to this capital.”Lawmakers also said more funding would be needed during a House Small Business Committee hearing on the loan program Thursday. “We all know it’s going to need more money again soon,” said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.Applications for the initial PPP funds were being processed at a rate of about $40 billion a day in the final days before funding was exhausted, signaling that the replenishment could tap out quickly.Some large, publicly traded companies and big chains such as  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). that have been criticized for tapping the loan fund may opt for the Main Street facility, making more money available for smaller businesses, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business.The U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidance on Thursday emphasizing that borrowers must certify in good faith they need the loan, saying it’s “unlikely” a public company with substantial market value and access to capital will be able to do so. Firms that have already taken money can return it by May 7 without penalty, the guidance said.Still, an NFIB survey of its members on April 17 showed 26% were in the process of submitting an application for loans when funding was exhausted, and it’s not clear how many will be able to access funding before it runs out again, Wade said. Also, there were potentially millions of self-employed individuals and independent contractors shut out because they couldn’t start applying immediately, she said.“It’s a good second push to get money to small business owners, but there’s still a large number of small business owners who are still waiting to access this program,” Wade said.The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, offers loans of as much as $10 million that convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other expenses for two months. The SBA guarantees the loans for lenders to disburse, and there’s no comprehensive accounting yet of how much money has reached small firms.The SBA also stopped accepting applications last week for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, or EIDL, that offers low-interest financing and emergency advances of as much as $10,000 that don’t have to be repaid. Congress is adding $50 billion for loans and $10 billion for grants to that program.More than 1.6 million small businesses were approved for PPP funding before the money ran out, with an average loan of $206,000, according to an SBA report. About 755,500 firms have received EIDL grants and almost 27,000 disaster loans have been approved so far, the SBA reported Monday. But there have been millions of EIDL applications, and there are about 30 million small businesses in the U.S. employing about half the workforce.Congress will likely have to replenish the funds if they run out again, said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He compared the PPP to an incomplete bridge.“I don’t think we’re at the point where we can realistically say, ‘The bridge has stopped and we’re sorry if you fall off the end of it,’” he said.The next funding round includes a $60 billion carve-out for small lenders, which is designed to help them compete with larger banks that will be more actively issuing loans this time, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.Even though there is money set aside for smaller banks and financial institutions to lend, that won’t fix the problem that companies with existing banking relationships “are still going to get at the front of the line,” said John Arensmeyer, chief executive officer of the Small Business Majority, a small business advocacy group.Arnesmeyer said he thinks Mnuchin “will change his tune” about the need for additional funding in a couple of weeks when the crisis gets worse and the problems faced by small firms deepen.“The sheer magnitude of businesses that don’t have revenue and are closing and/or laying massive numbers of people is staggering,” he said.Sinnidra Taylor said she has little hope that her business, the Crazy Waffle Bar in New Orleans will see any of the newly approved funds for the PPP.“I am excited that they have allotted more money. I am also not confident that I will get any,” Taylor said. “I have the feeling small businesses such as mine are being overlooked and falling through the cracks.”?2020 Bloomberg L.P.",0,0
"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's High Court ordered state arms maker Denel to hand over millions in employees' tax payments to the government, union officials said - a case that has refocused attention on cash-strapped state firms and their drain on the economy.The Solidarity union sued Denel last month, accusing it of deducting tax and other payments from employees' salaries then failing to hand the cash over to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and other bodies.Solidarity claimed Tuesday's ruling as a victory in what it described as a broader fight to hold state firms to account. A Denel spokeswoman it had not received details of the ruling but would meet its obligations. She said Denel had approached SARS to see if it could delay payments.The lawsuit came after Denel, a cornerstone of South Africa's once-mighty defense industry, said it would not be able to pay employees their full salaries in June and asked the government for a 2.8 billion rand ($182.43 million) cash injection a week later.Denel's recapitalization request, one of a clutch of bailouts needed for debt-ridden state-run companies, has piled pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa who has promised to overhaul Africa's most industrialized economy after decades of corruption and mismanagement.Investors and credit rating agencies raised the alarm in July, when the government said it would give power utility Eskom 59 billion rand of additional financial support over the next two years, on top of an already-promised bailout of 230 billion rand spread over the next decade.Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity's Legal Services, told Reuters he thought the ruling would cost Denel millions of rand.""It is regrettable that we had to go to court just to draw Denel's attention to payments that it should have made a while ago.”The company, which produces military equipment from ammunition to attack helicopters, has said it is trying to turn its operations around by exiting loss-making businesses and pushing to win contracts to ease liquidity constraints.",0,0

"By Emma Rumney and Barbara LewisCULLINAN, South Africa (Reuters) - The owner of one of the world's most famous diamond mines could be about a decade away from clearing its multi-million-dollar debts, in a sign of the struggles facing an industry assailed by synthetic rivals and uncertain demand. Petra Diamonds bought Cullinan in 2008, aiming to breathe new life into the South African mine renowned for yielding the largest rough gem diamond ever found - 3,106 carats - and being the world's main source of rare blue diamonds.The London-listed miner, which acquired Cullinan from industry leader De Beers, borrowed heavily to revamp the facility and began mining a new section of ore last July.Petra told Reuters its debts from the mine stood at around 65 percent of its overall $650 million in borrowing, which would represent about $420 million.Cullinan's general manager Juan Kemp added that it could take ""between five and 10 years"" from the opening of the new section to clear the debts related to the mine. That goes beyond the 2022 maturity of Petra's bond notes. The company says it expects to generate free cash flow this year - a target it had hoped to reach in 2017 before being derailed by strikes and construction delays - and start reducing its debts. Kemp said one thought kept him awake at night: ""When will we get that next big stone?""Ben Davis, mining analyst at?Liberum, said the diamond prices Petra had achieved were below market expectations.""Everyone is very much hoping, for the sake of the equity holders and debt holders, it will deliver more higher-quality stones,"" he added.The miner's difficulties reflect in part the problems facing the industry - which often takes years to recover huge investments - including new competition from synthetic diamonds and sluggish demand, especially for small stones.In a sign of the times, De Beers, owned by  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), last year abandoned its decades-old policy of refusing to sell man-made diamonds as jewelry. GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ic5k2ODIAMOND PRICESMan-made diamonds require less investment than mining natural stones and can offer more attractive margins.Synthetic producers spend around $300-500 per carat produced, according to a 2018 report by Bain & Company. De Beers' lab-grown diamonds sell for $800 per carat. Petra, by contrast, has to shift 20,000 tonnes of earth at Cullinan to yield one cup of diamonds, at an average cost in the first half of their financial year of $55 per carat, leaving it with a margin of $41 per carat. Industry experts say synthetic production accounts for a small percentage of the market, but is growing fast. De Beers is investing $94 million over four years to build a U.S. factory that will churn out 500,000 carats a year, for example, while Chinese producers are stepping up output.Prices are also under pressure. Diamond miners say sales are seasonal and fall off after the Christmas rush, but the industry's giants have nonetheless reported weaker prices. Alrosa, the world's biggest diamond seller by volume, said in January sales were down 44 percent year on year, while De Beers, the biggest seller by value, said the first 2019 sales cycle was 25 percent lower than in 2018. ""Diamond prices have come under pressure from a toxic combination of deteriorating consumer confidence in China, growth in synthetic jewelry capacity, working capital finance withdrawal ... and jewelry recycling,"" Davis said.The tougher landscape is widening the disparities within the diamond mining industry itself. Big players, led by De Beers and Alrosa, have the money and technology to expand in places such as Namibia and Russia, while mid-tier miners like Petra, and smaller players look to eke out the resources from older mines. Petra gained control of Cullinan, east of Pretoria, for $80 million. Previous owner De Beers had dismissed the 116-year-old mine as not profitable enough. For Petra, it is its flagship project and its most capital-heavy, and thus central to shareholder confidence. DIRTY COLORA single large, valuable stone could bring in millions of dollars and lighten Petra's debt load. So far, however, the only large stones recovered from the new mining section have been a dirty color, and low quality. Kemp said the new section, which analysis suggests should be rich, had yet to show what it can produce. ""We expect a large stone at some point,"" he said. In the absence of rarer gems and weak prices for small diamonds, averages for Cullinan stones have slipped from $140 per carat in the first half of its 2018 financial year to an expected $96 for the first half of this year - the lowest since 2010. That helped prompt a 30-percent fall in Petra's share price since it published prices in January, extending a steep decline over the previous two years. The miner has bought and developed four other African mines. Jacques Breytenbach, Petra's finance director, said pricing at Cullinan was variable from one period to the next, and that the market tended to be weaker at the end of the calendar year due to destocking.

"(Bloomberg) -- One hedge fund manager is getting some inspiration from an unlikely source: the Robinhood crowd.Adam Sender’s volatility hedge fund has climbed 30% this year -- in part by betting on and against stocks that have been popular on the retail trading app. He notched gains by wagering around stocks including carmakers Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc., NIO Inc. and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.By watching Robinhood traders, Sender is embracing the speculative fervor brought on by retail investors who have far less experience and insight into the companies. Robinhood has become a go-to trading platform for individual investors during the Covid-19 pandemic, who are largely stuck at home without much entertainment.The day trading crowd has “created the late ‘90s type of environment I thrive on,” Sender said in an interview, referring to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. A significant portion of the gains were also made by betting on S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, as well as large-cap technology names.Founded in 2016, Sender Company & Partners is among a handful of volatility funds taking advantage of the return of market turbulence sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. And the fund has outperformed its peers. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, an early indicator of industry performance, is roughly flat this year through July.In a bet on tech, some of Sender’s top holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). All were up in the first seven months, with PayPal rising the most at about 81%.Sender previously worked for Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors before starting Exis Capital Management in 1998. He grew Exis to more than $1 billion in assets before shuttering it in 2014 after a tough year of performance and amid a lawsuit with Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings (OTC:FRFHF) Ltd.He’s now finding smaller is better at his $100 million fund, though he’s looking to double the assets amid a bout of success. His paycheck is also tied to that success -- the fund charges 40% for performance, but has a 0% management fee.“Unfortunately, the hedge fund industry has become an asset-gathering strategy,” Sender said of wanting to stay small. “Back when I started in the industry, hedge funds were geared for absolute performance -- they weren’t geared for safety.”?2020 Bloomberg L.P.",1,1

"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus urged European governments to step up plans for a ""likely"" no-deal Brexit and settle a long-running subsidy dispute with the United States to help limit trade risks for Europe's largest planemaker.The twin concerns surrounding Airbus's cross-border factory network prompted Chief Executive Guillaume Faury to issue a warning about rising trade tensions even as he unveiled stronger than expected second-quarter profits, driving up Airbus shares.Airbus builds wings for commercial aircraft in Britain, where new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to lead the country out of the European Union on Oct. 31 whether he has secured a negotiated departure or not, fuelling speculation in currency markets of a disorderly Brexit.""It is now obvious that 'no deal' is likely and we want all governments to be prepared for that, which was not the case by end of March,"" Faury told reporters, referring to Britain's originally planned exit date from the EU. His comments echo those of Britain's employers' group, which says the EU is less prepared for a no-deal Brexit than Britain.The European Commission says it has published almost 100 preparedness notices including several on aviation and overseen dozens of other legal steps to be ready for a no-deal Brexit.Airbus has built a stockpile of about one month's supply of aircraft parts as a buffer to cope with Britain leaving the EU without a transitional deal, Faury said. That contributed to a heavy drain on cash in the first half of the year.Plane parts are exempt from default World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs under a 1980 pact signed by both the EU and Britain in its own right. But Airbus is worried extra red tape could slow supply chains and hamper the movement of engineers.Faury also sounded a broader alarm about rising global tensions and in particular recent U.S. threats to impose sanctions on European planes and other goods following WTO rulings against European government subsidies to Airbus.The French CEO called for a settlement in the long-running dispute, while Airbus included a warning in its results for the first time of damage to deliveries and finances if the punitive tariffs go ahead. The EU is gearing up to impose counter-tariffs after the WTO ruled separately against U.S. subsidies to Boeing (NYSE:BA).""It’s important that there is a resolution at a given point, a settlement before tariffs are applied,"" Faury said.""We see the trade wars around the world growing and we don't believe this is something ... industry can benefit from and citizens can benefit from,"" he said.PROFIT BEATEurope's largest aerospace group said second-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 72% to 1.98 billion euros ($2.2 billion), led by strong demand for jetliners. Revenues rose 23% to 18.32 billion euros.Analysts were on average forecasting adjusted quarterly operating income of 1.77 billion euros on revenues of 17.82 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.Shares in Airbus opened up 1.2% against a flat market.Airbus is trying to overcome industrial delays at a newly expanded plant in Hamburg, Germany, which has been struggling with enhanced cabins for the in-demand A321neo single-aisle.Airbus kept annual delivery and financial targets, but said it was studying how to increase the share of the A321neo within the wider A320neo family, with more details expected in months.Airbus is nonetheless on course to be the world's largest planemaker in 2019 as U.S. rival Boeing faces a longer-than-expected grounding of its 737 MAX, ordered by worldwide regulators in March in the wake of two fatal accidents.Boeing last week posted its largest-ever quarterly loss due to the crisis.Airbus took 75 million euros in new charges in the second quarter related to the cost of winding down its A380 superjumbo program after deciding to scrap output due to weak demand.Air France-KLM on Tuesday announced plans to retire the world's largest jetliner to concentrate on smaller models like the A350, which Airbus said was on track to break even this year after progress in curbing costs.Airbus took 90 million euros in other charges including compliance costs as it pursues a four-year-old investigation into the use of middlemen in aircraft and other sales. People familiar with the matter have said Airbus hopes to submit the results of its own internal probe to UK and French investigators around the end of the year - a step toward what it hopes will result in a fine rather than criminal charges.Faury declined detailed to comment on the probe.""It’s going in the right direction, it’s progressing, but I’m unable to tell you when it will come to an end,"" he said.

The case, which has caused tension between the United States and Turkey, accuses Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions through sham transactions in gold, food and medicine.Andrew Hruska, the bank's U.S. lawyer, said at a court hearing that the bank had been reassured it would not give up its right to challenge the court's jurisdiction by responding to the charges. He said he had been given permission by the bank's general manager to enter a plea on its behalf.""Now that those issues have been resolved, we're ready to proceed,"" he said.U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ordered Hruska to obtain written authorization from Halkbank before entering the plea.

"By John McCrank(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) on Wednesday agreed to a long-awaited experiment to test the effects of lowering stock exchange fees following criticism the current pricing system ultimately hurts investors.The pilot would force exchanges to lower the fees they charge for matching buy and sell orders and the size of rebates they pay market makers, allowing the SEC to analyze if the current system distorts traders' decisions about where to send orders.Consumer advocates say the current pricing regime creates conflicts of interest by giving incentives for brokers to send their customers’ orders to the exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would obtain the best result for the end clients.Currently, the fees exchanges can charge for trades they execute are capped at 30 cents per 100 shares. Rebates, which not all exchanges pay, are generally in line with the fee cap.The so-called access fee pilot, first proposed in July 2016 by a committee of market experts picked by the SEC, would require all exchanges to test capping fees lower than their current levels across different buckets of stocks, reducing the amount of funds available to pay rebates.One bucket would offer no rebates at all.On Wednesday, the Commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposal for the transaction fee pilot.""The transaction-fee pilot should give the Commission significantly more robust data than we have now to assess how fees and rebates affect order routing, execution quality, and market depth,"" Commissioner Robert Jackson said in a statement.The three main U.S. exchange operators had strongly opposed the plan, saying it would make stocks harder to trade. Those operators are the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, Cboe Global Markets Inc, which owns No. 2 U.S. stock exchange Bats, and Nasdaq Inc The bourses collectively pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, which they have said compensate market makers for the risks of providing liquidity. Without that additional liquidity, investors, listed companies and exchanges would all suffer, they say.The exchanges also said that without the ability to pay rebates, it would be harder for them to compete with private broker-run trading venues, known as dark pools, which have fewer regulatory burdens.The full details of the SEC pilot proposal will be released at a later date and subject to industry feedback.

"Investing.com - Asian markets were mostly lower in morning trade on Monday as Beijing released a white paper on the weekend and blamed the U.S. for escalating the trade war.The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component declined 0.7% and 0.6% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.6%.Over the weekend, China issued a white paper that claimed the U.S. is an untrustworthy negotiator and blamed it for starting global trade problems.The escalating trade war has not “made America great again” and “will only make things worse for all sides,” the paper said, as trade actions taken by U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have done serious harm to the U.S. economy due to increased production costs.Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said at a press conference on Sunday that the main reason trade talks stalled last month was that “the U.S. has backtracked.”“During the consultations, China has overcome many difficulties and put forward pragmatic solutions. However, the U.S. has backtracked, and when you give them an inch, they want a yard,” Wang said.Separately, Dai Xianglong, former governor of the People’s Bank of China, warned in a press event on Friday that the global economy would decline “if the China-U.S. trade war continues to grow larger, it may cause the global economy to decline.”“The consequence of the China-U.S. trade war not only will be reflected in both countries, but will also extend to relevant regions, extend to the whole world.”“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he added.On Sunday, China implemented previously announced tariff hikes and said it will take action against “unreliable” foreign companies, with a list of violators pending.Although not a major directional driver, a private survey showed China’s Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers’ Index for May was 50.2, slightly above the expected level of 50.“The stronger rise in overall new business supported a renewed expansion in buying activity among Chinese manufacturing firms.

"By Gleb StolyarovNIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia (Reuters) - Germany's Daimler and some others have stopped dealing with sanctions-hit van maker GAZ, controlled by Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, he told reporters, adding he was ready to give up control of the company.Deripaska and some of the businesses which he controls were hit by U.S. sanctions a year ago, when Washington imposed sweeping measures on some of Russia's biggest companies and business figures to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity.""Sanctions against GAZ, Russia's biggest van maker, have not yet taken full effect due to licenses for extensions issued by Washington, but are impacting the company, Deripaska said.""It's a tough time,"" he told reporters on Tuesday on a visit to the GAZ factory in Russia's central region of Nizhny Novgorod.If sanctions are not lifted, he said, there was no chance GAZ would survive, even if the company is granted another extension in early July, because these extensions ""do not give you full freedom.""A lot of suppliers and partners have stopped working with GAZ due to the risk of secondary sanctions, Deripaska said, adding there was also huge pressure on GAZ from its banks.GAZ, which competes with a joint venture between Ford and its Russian partner Sollers among others, mainly sells its vehicles in Russia and the former Soviet Union, making it less dependent on dollar sales.MARKET SHARE However, GAZ has contracts with Western partners and relies on vital supplies of foreign components. Along with Daimler, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and U.S.-based Cummins (NYSE:CMI) have contracts with GAZ.Volkswagen, Daimler and Cummins did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment.The company is also losing market share to rivals like Toyota and Ford, Deripaska added.GAZ did not disclose its 2018 sales. According to the AEB lobby group, its sales of light commercial vehicles, or vans and minibuses, rose 4 percent in 2018 to 60,677.The U.S. Treasury said in March it was extending by four months to July 6 a deadline for investors to divest from GAZ, giving Deripaska more time to lower his stake and potentially allowing the company to be removed from the U.S. sanctions list.Washington lifted sanctions on Deripaska's main assets - aluminum maker Rusal and its parent En+ - in January after he dropped control in them. Asked if he was ready to give up control of GAZ, Deripaska said: ""Yes, as it was done in En+.""Yet GAZ does not have such weight in global markets as Rusal and En+, so talks on any deal are slower and more difficult, sources close to GAZ previously told Reuters.Deripaska himself remains blacklisted and is suing the United States, alleging it had overstepped its legal powers in imposing sanctions on him.He admits his suit against Washington ""would be a difficult case"" but still hopes his name will eventually be cleared, he told reporters.

"By Engen Tham and Anshuman DagaSHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some airlines affiliated with China's HNA Group Co Ltd are delaying aircraft lease payments to lessors, and Export-Import Bank of China, which is a long-term financer of the group, has formed a team to handle the conglomerate's liquidity issues, several banking and leasing sources said.Executives from leasing units of Chinese lenders including Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988), China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd (SS:600016) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) have held talks with some HNA-linked airlines to recover payments, the sources said.""Some payments have been delayed by over two months,"" said one senior Beijing-based executive at a Chinese lessor. He said HNA airlines had informed the lessor that payments would be made soon as they expected banks to support HNA in coming months.HNA, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, said in a statement to Reuters: ""HNA and its subsidiaries are maintaining stable operations, and are in the process of gradually paying each lessor's fees as planned.""HNA's $50 billion worth of deal-making over the past two years, which included investments in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBkGn) and the Hilton (N:HLT) hotels group, has sparked intense scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.In June, the Chinese government told major banks to review their credit exposure to HNA and a handful of other non-state companies, putting pressure on its finances.Some of the sources from lessors and banks said HNA's flagship Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) and smaller ones including Lucky Air and Capital Airlines had missed payments, while Tianjin Airlines was seeking to extend the term for payments due this year.The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Lucky Air and Capital Airlines declined to comment. Tianjin Airlines, Bank of Communications Financial Leasing, Minsheng Financial Leasing and EXIM did not respond to requests for comment.Hainan Airlines suspended trading on Jan. 10 pending an announcement. The reason for the share suspension is unclear.Tianjin Airlines has asked a Chinese lessor to delay June rental payments for three aircraft, said one source with direct knowledge.Another source said one HNA-affiliated airline has told Bank of Communications Financial Leasing that it will not be paying rental payments due in January. He did not name the airline.In the last few weeks, executives from some international lessors have flown to China to meet executives at HNA-affiliated airlines and thrash out a repayment plan, the sources said.""This is a widespread issue among many lessors but they understand that a lot depends on whether banks re-open their funding for HNA and lessors are betting on that,"" said one financier at a European bank.In November, Airfinance Journal reported the delays in lease rental payments and the problems have intensified since then, the sources said.However, Robert Martin, the chief executive of BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588), said his company, the leasing unit of Bank of China, did not have problems on lease payments by HNA-linked airlines.""BOC Aviation has very strong focus on receivables management and we ended 2017 with a collection rate of 99.9 percent. This included airline subsidiaries of the HNA Group,"" Martin said in an e-mail.RECOVERY GROUPFaced with a slew of repayment obligations and concerns about rising financing costs, HNA had its creditworthiness downgraded in November by S&P Global Ratings, as a result of its ""aggressive financial policy"".Underlining the growing concern by lenders over the group's repayment obligations, the Beijing-based EXIM set up a team this month to handle HNA's debt, which the conglomerate is struggling to repay, banking sources said.HNA has promised to pay all outstanding delayed payments by the end of January, said a source with direct knowledge.EXIM did not respond to request for comments.EXIM's HNA team was set up after meetings at the conglomerate's headquarters in Hainan, in southern China, late last year, when HNA asked for new loans to cover existing debt, the source said.HNA has also been attempting to re-organize its debt commitments from other lenders, the banking sources said.BIG PLAYERHNA Group has 223 planes on either financial or operating leases, according to financial reports at the end of June, making up around 62 percent of their fleet.Many aircraft leases in China are full-recourse leases, said David Yu, a professor and aircraft leasing specialist at New York University Shanghai. This means lessors are on the hook for the money banks have lent them to acquire the planes, putting them at risk of default, he said.Depending on the terms of the loans, lenders would be able to take steps including asking for early repayment of loans to seizing planes for sale. But the lessors for the HNA airlines had not taken any steps to seize any planes as they were confident of receiving the payments, the sources said.",0,0

"By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) - About 100 United Steelworkers union (USW) members rallied on Wednesday outside a  LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) Houston oil refinery over a lack of negotiations there on a new local contract. Talks on a national oil-workers agreement are due to begin next month with Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa), as the lead industry negotiator. Existing union contracts expire on Feb. 1. However, local groups are beginning discussions on individual plant issues ahead of the national talks. At least four other plants also have begun exchanging proposals on local issues, according to the USW. LyondellBasell officials did not begin talks on union local issues as planned on Monday, Marcos Velez, a USW International representative said in an interview on Wednesday. The existing contract covering the plant's 485 union workers expires on Feb. 1.""They called and said they couldn't make it (Monday) and would call about meeting Tuesday,"" Velez said. ""It's Wednesday and we're still waiting to meet.""A Lyondell spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday.The USW group carried signs that said ""coming soon"" and showed silhouettes of people picketing. Union-represented Lyondell workers were off their jobs for 3 1/2 months during a strike and contract talks in 2015. The national agreement, which covers wages, job security, health and safety issues, will be combined with terms of the agreement on local issues at each plant to complete the contract for each location. Velez said Lyondell also canceled meetings during the 2015 strike.""It's not uncommon, but it's unacceptable,"" he said.During the rally, USW activist Joshua Lege used a bullhorn to speak to the workers, many of them wearing blue work coveralls as they lined up in front of the refinery.""They say they want peace and professionalism, but they want war,"" Lege said.

"By Stephanie Nebehay and Ryan WooGENEVA/BEIJING (Reuters) - The rapid rise in coronavirus raised fears of a pandemic on Friday, with five countries reporting their first cases, the World Health Organization warning it could spread worldwide and Switzerland cancelling the giant Geneva car show.World share markets crashed again, winding up their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis and bringing the global wipeout to $5 trillion. Hopes that the epidemic that started in China late last year would be over in months, and that economic activity would quickly return to normal, have been shattered as the number of international cases has spiraled.""The outbreak is getting bigger,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. ""The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.""Switzerland joined countries banning big events to try to curb the epidemic, forcing cancellation of next week's Geneva international car show, one of the industry's most important gatherings.The United States asked its military in Saudi Arabia to avoid crowded venues including malls and cinemas. Mainland China reported 327 new cases, the lowest since Jan. 23, taking its tally to more than 78,800 cases with almost 2,800 deaths. China's three biggest airlines restored some international flights and the Shanghai fashion show, initially postponed, went ahead online.TROOPS DEPLOYEDBut as the outbreak eases in China, it is surging elsewhere.Five more countries have reported their first case, all with travel history connected to Italy. They were Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, Netherlands and Lithuania, Lindmeier said.Countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.Bulgaria said it was ready to deploy up to 1,000 troops and military equipment to the border with neighboring Turkey to prevent illegal migrant inflows. It said it would not allow massive inflows at a time when it is stepping up preventive measures against the coronavirus. It has not reported any cases.Ratings agency Moody's said a pandemic - usually taken to mean a disease spreading quickly in different places - would trigger global and U.S. recessions in the first half of the year.Mongolia, which has yet to confirm a case, placed its president, Battulga Khaltmaa, in quarantine as a precaution after he returned from a trip to China, state media reported.A Chinese official called the epidemic the most difficult health crisis in the country's modern history. Another said some recovered patients had been found to be infectious, suggesting the epidemic may be even harder to eradicate than previously thought.Lindmeier said the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected.In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease.U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to expand production of protective gear.In Europe, France's reported cases doubled, Germany warned of an impending epidemic and Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East, announced tighter border controls.The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rose to 17 and those testing positive increased by more than 200 to 655. Germany has nearly 60 cases, France about 38 and Spain 23, according to a Reuters count.Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a ""decisive point"" in efforts to prevent a wider outbreak, the WHO said.OLYMPIC DOUBTSSouth Korea has the most cases outside China. It reported 571 new infections on Friday, bringing the total to 2,337. The outbreak, which has killed 13 people in South Korea, has also dented President Moon Jae-in's popularity, a poll showed.The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr Mike Ryan, said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has reported the most deaths outside China - 34 from 388 reported cases.U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring the spread of coronavirus in Iran and India, where only a handful of cases have been reported, sources said.Japan is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympics in July but Ryan said discussions were being held about whether to go ahead.Organizers will decide next week on the ceremonial torch relay, due to arrive on March 20 for a 121-day journey past landmarks including Mount Fuji and Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park.As of Friday, confirmed cases in Japan had risen above 200, with four deaths, excluding more than 700 cases on a quarantined cruise liner, Diamond Princess.A British man who was infected on the ship had died, bringing the death toll among passenger to six, Kyodo newswire reported.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had called for schools to close and vowed to prevent a severe blow to an economy already teetering on the brink of recession.Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, where the coronavirus has killed two people and infected more than 90, quarantined a pet dog of a coronavirus patient after its nasal and oral samples tested ""weak positive"", though authorities had no evidence the virus can be transmitted to pets.Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html ",0,0

"By Karen BrettellNEW YORK (Reuters) - A cash shortage that has plagued crucial overnight lending markets during the past few weeks is likely to flare back up heading into year-end, although measures taken by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity means the worst of the strains are probably over.The Fed began daily repurchase agreements in mid-September, after the repo rate for overnight loans surged to 10%, the highest since the financial crisis and far above the Fed’s then maximum fed funds target rate of 2.25%.The operations inject cash into the banking system, after demand for overnight loans from companies, banks and other borrowers overwhelmed supply.Analysts said the need to settle large amounts of Treasury issuance and cash needs from companies to pay taxes were factors behind the cash crunch.A reduction in excess bank reserves, cash held at the Fed that can be made available for loans, was also a large contributor, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in particular having cut the cash it holds on deposit at the Fed by 57% this year.The Fed's repo operations will run until at least January.Last week it also began purchasing Treasury bills, which will increase reserves in the system. When the Fed buys securities from a bank, it credits the bank’s reserve account.Analysts and market participants say these moves helped stabilize the market, where there are around $2.2 trillion in outstanding loans.But a jump in funding costs last week show that further bouts of volatility are likely to re-emerge. Banks and other large investors typically reduce risk-taking as they close their books for year-end, with fewer funds being made available for loans.“It’s a step in the right direction and it really does help to fundamentally address some of these issues of there being too few reserves in the banking system,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.That said, “I just don’t think that year-end is going to be particularly clean. I think that we will see some additional repo volatility.”The Fed began reducing its bond holdings in late 2017. Purchases after the financial crisis, known as quantitative easing, were designed to boost investment and economic growth.GRAPHIC: U.S. Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7722/7653/BalanceSheet.pngMORE STEPS NEEDEDTo reduce the risk of further disruptions, market participants say they expect more interventions from the Fed.One issue with the Fed’s purchases of Treasury bills is that money market funds are a major holder of the debt and will be reluctant to give it up, knowing that new purchases will come with lower returns.“Money funds just happen to be the largest owner and probably are not looking to sell, because whatever we reinvest would needless to say be lower than when we purchased it originally,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.Money market funds hold around 20% of the $2.25 trillion in outstanding Treasury bills, according to Fed data.Dealers own few bills compared to Fed demand. On average they have owned $22 billion in bills year-to-date, below the $60 billion the Fed plans to purchase each month, Cabana said.If the Fed’s purchases disrupt liquidity in the bill market, which could occur in the coming months, the Fed may expand purchases to short-dated Treasury notes, which would be easier to source, Cabana said.Dealers held $83 billion in notes with maturities up to three years this year, on average.GRAPHIC: U.S. primary dealers' Treasury holdings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7723/7654/PrimaryDealerHoldings.pngThe most important fix to ensure there is not a repeat of September, however, would be for the Fed to introduce a standing repo facility.The Fed has said it is looking at a permanent repo facility but has not yet committed to such a move.",0,0

"By Sinéad Carew(Reuters) - Financial stocks have lagged the broader equity market since the start of the year and since the late March crisis-low. But not all stocks are created equal in the S&P index that tracks the industry, which is down 23% year-to-date. In fact, so far in 2020, the lead performers of the S&P 500 Financial sector (SPSY) have even outperformed the high-flying Nasdaq (IXIC), which is up almost 23% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is up 1%, and the Dow is down 7% for the year so far.The sector's wide performance disparity stems partly from low interest rates exposure versus trading exposure in a market that has risen sharply since March. Stocks that have performed well include exchanges, index companies or banks with trading desks or M&A advisory businesses and some insurance companies, said Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equities and portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). ""The ones relying on the yield curve and the short rates to make money have been more challenged,"" Dunn said, referring to banks that are mostly dependent on a steep yield curve to boost profits from their loan business. While many stocks in the sector are relatively cheap, some investors are wary of economic uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's suggestion it will keep rates low for a long time. ""If you expect the economy to grow and interest rates to start to rise, then banks are very compelling,"" said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. ""If the economy continues to grow and the Fed is successful at keeping rates very low you probably would be better off in exchanges and the banks that don't earn all their income from spread lending.""The leader of the financials pack is trading platform Marketaxess (O:MKTX) up 46% year-to-date, followed by MSCI (K:MSCI), up 32%, and then insurer Progressive (N:PGR), up 26%. In all, eight stocks in the index, which has more than 60 stocks, have shown double-digit percentage gains so far in 2020. Other outperformers include investment managers Blackrock Inc (N:BLK) and T Rowe Price (O:TROW) and stock exchanges, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE). Like MSCI, stock index company S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI) has also been in favor. On the other end of the spectrum,  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) was leading losses down 60%, followed by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s more than 48% year-to-date decline and Lincoln Nationals (N:LNC) roughly 44% drop.In all, 47 of the index's stocks have shown declines in the double-digit percentage range.Compared to the broader financial sector the bank subsector <.SPXBK> has fallen 37% so far this year while the insurance subsector <.SPXIN> has dropped 18%. While the financial index has risen almost 34% since the market's March 23 low, this gain compares with a 46% jump from the S&P 500, and an almost 43% gain for the Dow and a roughly 60% gain for Nasdaq.

"(Bloomberg) -- The latest collision between Italy’s markets and politics is beginning to fuel concern that shock waves could spread to elsewhere in Europe.As Italian bond yields climbed toward multi-year highs, the euro extended losses and the region’s equities slumped, while haven assets such as German bunds and the Swiss franc rallied.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned that the risk of a wider impact of the Italian turmoil has increased, even as markets in Spain and Portugal -- seen as a key barometer for any debt contagion to Europe’s periphery -- have so far shown little sign of anxiety.Budget official Claudio Borghi’s comments that the common currency is “not sufficient” to solve the country’s fiscal problems have rekindled worries that a breakup of the world’s largest trade bloc is still a possibility. He later denied that the country’s populist government had any plans to leave the euro.“European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Alessio Rizzi wrote in a research note. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen.”Markets were firmly in risk-off mode Tuesday, with demand rising for popular risk hedges. Italy’s two-year bonds took the brunt of the selling pressure, flattening the country’s yield curve. The cost of protection against a potential credit default by the nation rose and traders priced in a greater premium for three-month money-market borrowings over overnight loans.Euro, YieldsThe euro dropped by as much as 0.6 percent Tuesday to $1.1505, a six-week low. Italian 10-year yields climbed 14 basis points to 3.44 percent, re-testing a May 29 peak that was a four-year high. The spread over those on their German peers breached 300 basis points for the second time this year.Still, there’s little sign yet of a contagion effect across peripheral euro-area bonds. Ten-year yields in Spain and Portugal were little changed at 1.53 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively. Similar rates in Greece climbed nine basis points to 4.31 percent.The yield premium investors demand on benchmark Italian bonds over Spain has hit a seven-year high and is climbing toward a record 202 basis points reached in 2011. Strategists at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA including Jaime Costero expect the spread to widen further, as Spanish debt retains its appeal amid little spillover impact from Italy’s market volatility.“Political developments in Italy are still center-stage and will probably continue to remain the most critical driver for the euro for the time being,” analysts at UniCredit SpA wrote in a note. “Still, contained contagion in the bond markets implies that the budget talks are still perceived as a “local” issue. The market behavior suggests to us that the Italian developments are likely to just add “noise” to the common currency at the moment, but are not seen as grave enough to trigger a heavy sell-off.”‘Fade the Pop’Strategists at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA led by Valentin Marinov remain bullish on the euro as they see most of the Italy-related negativity already priced in, and with continued support from the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy normalization. Even as Italy’s bonds and stocks saw increased volatility in recent months as the country’s Five Star Movement-League coalition drew up their deficit targets, the shared currency had been relatively resilient.The Italian economy’s underlying strength may mean it’s time to ease out of risk-off hedges despite political risks, according to Mizuho International Plc.“The protection trades are ramping up,” head of European rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. But “this is a great opportunity for investors to fade the pop in some structures. Most obvious, to us, is to fade the rally in German bonds outright, as we do not think this flare-up between Italy and the EU will drag on the euro-area economy.”‘Sore Point’For others, Italy’s euroskeptic government is just the embodiment of the the populist sentiment taking root across Europe, which could threaten the bloc’s future and weigh on the euro for the months or even years to come.Borghi, head of Italy’s lower house budget committee and a well-known euroskeptic, said in an interview on Radio Anch’io that “Italy, with its own currency, would be able to resolve its problems.”“The comments about Italy having its own currency have touched a sore point,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank International. “While the return of the lira would be almost impossible and hugely inflationary even if it could happen, the fact that the remarks can be read as anti-EMU sentiment are worrisome.”",0,0

"By Ginger GibsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, touted on Wednesday benefits he sees in federal government approval of T-Mobile US Inc's bid to acquire Sprint Corp, while also denying that he has worked directly for the company. Lewandowski said he remains in regular contact with the president and has daily contact with Trump's new campaign manager Brad Parscale. He has said he does not lobby on behalf of companies, but said he does consult with some corporations about navigating the federal government.""If the T-Mobile deal is going to move forward because it's going to create better 5G coverage in rural areas and create more jobs in the marketplace and help grow and compete with a competitive China, then without any hesitation I say we should have more jobs, we should be more competitive,"" Lewandowski said on Wednesday at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. ""I have no idea what the Justice Department does on it. I haven't spoken to anyone at the Justice Department on it.""U.S. antitrust enforcers have started reviewing T-Mobile's plan to buy Sprint for $26 billion, and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs. The two companies compete against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon to provide U.S. wireless service. Lewandowski is among those advising the No. 3 wireless company on its deal as it prepares for what should be a tough regulatory review process, the mobile provider said in a statement in May. Lobbying by former Trump officials has received increased attention after it was made public that Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney, was paid $1.2 million by Novartis and $600,000 by AT&T to consult about the administration.It is not uncommon for former political officials to lobby and consult with corporations after leaving the employment of an elected official.A T-Mobile spokeswoman declined to comment on Lewandowski.Lewandowski insisted he simply shares office space with a lobbying shop, Turnberry Solutions LLC, which is advising T-Mobile. Lobbying disclosure reports show T-Mobile has paid Turnberry Solutions LLC $170,000 since September 2017. T-Mobile said in May that Lewandowski ""is now affiliated with (Turnberry) and they have offered perspective to T-Mobile on a variety of topics, including the pending transaction."" ""T-Mobile hired Jason Osborne and Mike Rubino, which is a firm that is also housed at the same office space that I am, and I talk to these guys all the time,"" Lewandowski said when asked why T-Mobile said he was consulting with them. ""I haven't made a phone call. I've never called a government employee or a person and asked them to look at, help, solicit, move forward, pass any transaction, and I would challenge anybody in the room to find someone in the government who said I called and asked for a favor because I've never done it.""

"By Hyunjoo JinULSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) union chief warned its workers may face a similar crisis to the one hitting General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit as sales in key markets slide, adding that electric cars were 'evil' and will destroy jobs.South Korea's auto industry, known for its robust unions whose workers tend to be paid more and have better benefits than their compatriots in other sectors, has come to a crossroads.Blaming high labor costs and falling sales, General Motors (N:GM) plans to close one of its plants in the country by May and is weighing options for its three other factories.""We're feeling job anxiety. We're feeling a sense of crisis,"" Ha Bu-young, the head of the  Hyundai Motor  union, South Korea's biggest and most powerful union, told Reuters in an interview late last week.He said that at three of Hyundai's five plants in Ulsan, the world's biggest car factory complex, some workers had been asked to take longer holidays as sales of sedans and older model SUVs like the Santa Fe slow in the United States and other markets.Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) were also hit by diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing last year, leading to a slump in sales in the world's biggest auto market. The two automakers have flagged only modest global sales growth in 2018.  Longer term, Ha worries about the advent of electric cars, which when they go mainstream could wreak havoc on traditional auto jobs as they don't require engines and transmissions. Hyundai's union has predicted a drastic shift into electric cars could lead to a loss of 70 percent of Hyundai jobs in a worst case scenario.""Electric cars are disasters. They are evil. We are very nervous,"" he said.Ha said the union is studying how cars of the future might be built without slashing headcount and has proposed the automaker revive a committee to review the impact of new vehicles and new technology on jobs.He also noted that some 30,000 workers out of 50,000 union members will retire in 15 years, which could cushion the impact that cars of the future could have on staffing levels.FREE TRIPS TO EUROPEAt GM's South Korean unit, the threat of potential plant closures has led its union to offer to freeze wages and skip bonuses while about 15 percent of its employees have applied for a voluntary redundancy package. While there is a sense of crisis at Hyundai's union, the situation is not that dire.Hyundai's management has proposed the scaling back of some benefits such as free week-long trips to Europe for 500 workers annually as well as support for some employees' sporting events - a proposal that the union plans to oppose, a union official said.But the union will for the first time seek pay raises for temporary workers this year that are higher than those of full-time auto workers, responding to criticism that regular auto works are generously paid. It will ask for a 7.4 percent wage increase for temporary workers versus a 5.3 percent wage raise for regular workers, Ha said, in line with a policy advocated by the umbrella union for South Korea's metal workers.Last year Hyundai's union initially demanded annual wage increases of 7 percent for its full-time workers and won a raise of less than 5 percent after tense negotiations that involved strikes.The shift towards improving pay for non-full time workers could invite opposition within the union, said Ha, adding that he was trying to right old wrongs.

"Investing.com - Markets are regaining some poise following sharp moves overnight after Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq fueled fears that the strikes would lead to an escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran. U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street, but Dow futures are weighed down by a drop in shares of Boeing in the wake of another deadly plane crash. Oil prices have trimmed back overnight gains but remain higher, while gold is holding near new seven-year highs. Here’s what you need to know to start your day.Market jitters eased on Wednesday following frenzied early trading after a rocket attack by Iran on U.S. forces in Iraq raised the specter of a spiraling Middle East conflict.Hopes grew the U.S. would stop short of strong retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ""All is well!"", and ""So far, so good!"".Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also tweeted that the Iranians ""do not seek escalation or war"".Iran's missile attack came early on Wednesday, hours after the funeral of an Iranian commander who was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week.U.S. stock futures clawed back their early steep losses, with the S&P 500 futures contract rising 10 points, or 0.3% by 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), while Nasdaq 100 futures rose a similar amount. But Dow futures struggled to make headway, weighed down by a drop in shares of Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) in premarket trade.Boeing shares were hit by news that a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 airliner burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash that an initial report blamed on engine failure.A spokesman for the manufacturer said it was gathering more information.The 737 does not have the software feature implicated in crashes of the 737 MAX.

"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday it would recall 1.2 million Honda and Acura vehicles in North America to replace defective Takata airbags on the driver's side.The company said https://hondanews.com/channels/corporate-recalls/releases/statement-by-american-honda-regarding-recall-of-takata-desiccated-replacement-driver-front-airbag-inflators it was aware of one injury linked to the defect, which may have caused the airbag to rupture when it was deployed in a crash.Of the 23 total deaths worldwide linked to faulty Takata airbags, 21 have occurred in Honda vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the recall covers 1.1 million U.S. vehicles and is to replace inflators received ""either as a permanent Takata airbag inflator recall replacement or as a service part installed following a crash or problem with the airbag itself.""Another 100,000 vehicles are being recalled in Canada, Mexico and Central America, Honda said.The Honda models being recalled include 2001-2007 and 2009 Honda Accord, 2001-2005 Honda Civic, 2002-2007 and 2010-2011 Honda CR-V, 2003-2011 Honda Element, 2007 Honda Fit, 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey, 2003-2008 Honda Pilot, and 2006-2014 Honda Ridgeline.The Acura models include 2003 Acura 3.2CL, 2013-2016 Acura ILX, 2003-2006 Acura MDX, 2002-2003 Acura 3.2TL, 2004-2006 and 2009-2014 Acura TL, 2007-2016 Acura RDX, and 2010-2013 Acura ZDX.More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide.Repairs of the recalled Hondas and Acuras will begin immediately in the United States with replacement parts made by alternate suppliers, Honda said.Honda became aware of the issue after a Honda Odyssey crash, where the front airbag deployed and injured the driver's arm. An investigation later showed that manufacturing issues at Takata's Mexico facility introduced excessive moisture into the inflator during assembly, leading to the problem.The total number of recalled inflators is now about 21 million in about 12.9 million Honda and Acura vehicles that have been subject to recall for replacing Takata front airbag inflators in the United States, the company said.Automakers in the United States repaired more than 7.2 million defective Takata air bag inflators in 2018, as companies have ramped up efforts to track down parts in need of replacement.

"Investing.com - Shares in GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank in pre-market trade on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the firm and cut its price target.Specifically, these analysts cut their recommendation on the action camera maker to “underweight” from “equal-weight” while reducing the price target to $5 from the prior $9.50.Although GoPro managed to return to profitability at the end of 2017, these experts think that that investors may be giving the firm “too much credit”.Morgan Stanley admitted that its prior recommendation on the company was “too generous”, especially now that the holiday season is over and the firm cut prices on its latest HERO6 camera due to competition.These analysts believe that the only way for GoPro to boost demand for its products is by improving the underlying software and that negative trends seen last year will likely weigh on products both this year and next.Shares of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) slumped 6.03% to $5.92 in pre-market trade Tuesday.",0,0
"By Jessica DiNapoliNEW YORK (Reuters) - A video of 95-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch of the family that owns the voting majority of CBS Corp (N:CBS), can be reviewed in the U.S. broadcast and media company's legal battle against the family, a Delaware judge ruled on Wednesday.Redstone, however, will not be required to give testimony, the judge decided.National Amusements Inc, the Redstone family's holding company, and CBS are in the midst of a high-stakes legal dispute over control of the company and its potential merger with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also majority-owned by NAI. Shari Redstone, the daughter of Sumner, has pushed to combine Viacom with CBS.The health and mental faculties of Sumner Redstone, the founder and chairman emeritus of Viacom, and the majority owner of NAI, are a flashpoint for dispute in the battle for control. ""We are very pleased with the court's ruling today, which will now allow us to conduct appropriate discovery from National Amusements on the issue of who controls NAI,"" CBS said in a statement, adding that the video of Redstone would be kept confidential. National Amusements declined to comment.  CBS had pushed to have the tape, which could end up as evidence in the trial, included for review, while NAI has previously said that the recording broke California law because Redstone did not know he was being filmed.The contents of the video have not been made public. A source with knowledge of the situation said the video was taken by a CBS board member, is several minutes long and shows Sumner Redstone's physical and mental state.National Amusements must produce certain documents requested by CBS, according to court filings. CBS said it will also be able to secure National Amusements' documents relating to the 2016 ousting of five Viacom directors, including then-CEO Philippe Dauman.The CBS board had approved a dividend earlier this year that would dilute the Redstone family's majority voting rights in the company, in an attempt to prevent the merger with Viacom.

"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) estimate it will post a record $13 billion full-year loss, dragged down by its spluttering $100 billion Vision Fund, has renewed attention on a planned asset sell-down aimed at raising cash and restoring confidence.SoftBank shares fell as much as 4% on Tuesday before recovering to close up 5% after the group late on Monday said it sees a 1.8 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) full-year loss at the Vision Fund as its tech bets crumble.The disastrous performance at the fund on which Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has staked his reputation will drag the entire group to its largest annual loss, underscoring the need for his plan to raise up to 4.5 trillion yen through asset sales.While domestic carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) is seen as a possible target, SoftBank is dependent on its dividends for cash flow, leaving its stake in  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) the most likely to be sold down or monetized, UBS analyst Kei Takahashi wrote in a client note.SoftBank's biggest asset, its 26% stake in the Chinese e-commerce leader, has already been used as collateral to borrow more than a trillion yen, with collar transactions contributing a further 200 billion at the end of December.The Alibaba stake could be used to raise 3 trillion yen, Takahashi wrote, along with using its stake in wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), which just completed a merger with SoftBank's Sprint, as collateral for loans.The move comes as SoftBank is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to improve shareholder returns, with the group announcing a share buyback of up to 2.5 trillion yen. The rise in SoftBank's shares on Tuesday followed comments from the Japan Credit Rating Agency which said the impact of the expected annual loss on SoftBank's credit rating is limited as it will not greatly affect debt ratios.OPAQUESoftBank's willingness to leverage its investments adds to a lack of transparency around its finances, contributing to its persistent conglomerate discount. A third of its stake in SoftBank Corp has also been used as collateral, with Vision Fund investments similarly employed to raise cash.The Vision Fund recorded a loss of around 800 billion yen in the nine months to December.SoftBank did not provide details on which tech bets account for the wider loss in the quarter through March - a practice which is a long-standing irritant for analysts and investors who complain of the conglomerate's opaque accounting methods.

"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) said on Thursday its current-quarter revenue and profit would take a hit from supply chain disruptions and weak demand due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, the consumer goods company's second-biggest market.The epidemic, which originated in China's Hubei province and has claimed more than 2,000 lives, has raised concerns on its economic fallout stretching further into 2020, as companies have been forced to shut stores and curtail manufacturing in the critical market.The company's supply side has come under pressure, as it relies on 387 suppliers in China that ship more than 9,000 different materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished product items.""Each of these suppliers faces their own challenges in resuming operations,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference.P&G also said store traffic was considerably down in China and had fallen in other Asian countries as well.""Some of the demand has shifted online, but supply of delivery operators and labor is limited,"" Moeller added.The company, which reaffirmed its full-year targets, did not provide financial estimates for the hit it would take in the quarter ending March.",0,0
"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base.Carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. To avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, Daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels.Daimler's suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire Mercedes-Benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. ""Due to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that Daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,"" the carmaker said in its annual report. ""This could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. If suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,"" Daimler said.""Necessary capacity expansion at suppliers' plants could also require cost-effective participation,"" Daimler added.Daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing Daimler to step in. Daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.In its annual report, Daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices.""Generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,"" the annual report said.Daimler's report, published on Tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier.The Stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings.Daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States in a class-action suit which alleges the German carmaker used software to reduce emissions.Daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed.Among the legal risks faced by Daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. Daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities.Daimler also said in its report that Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche's total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier.

"By Aishwarya Venugopal(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) beat expectations for earnings and raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday as its investments in same-day delivery and pick-up services increased traffic to its website and stores, sending shares 19% higher.The retailer has spent billions of dollars on its push to compete with the ease of delivery provided by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, buying grocery delivery firm Shipt, and building in-store pickup and drive-up services.Target said one out of five customers who used its same-day service in the quarter were new, with shoppers collecting their orders from stores within a couple of minutes of placing them through the company's mobile app or website.""Q2 could not have gone better for Target,"" Charlie O'Shea, a vice president at ratings agency Moody's, said of the results.Led since 2014 by retail-industry veteran Brian Cornell, Target has bounced back from a slide three years ago which saw its margins drop, prompting a rethink that has seen it remodel hundreds of stores each year since. Like Walmart it has refitted its business to deal with the challenge presented by Amazon and other online retailers, also developing its line of own-brand goods to boost profits.Wednesday's results showed the company's same-day services drove more than three-fourths of a 34% increase in comparable digital sales in the quarter. Those online sales accounted for more than half of its total same-store sales. ""Because these options leverage our store infrastructure, technology and teams, same-day fulfillment delivers outstanding financial performance as well,"" Cornell told a post earnings call.The company's stock, which had already risen 29% this year, jumped 19% to a record high of $102.02, driving gains in other retail players and adding to broad gains for Wall Street. NO MARGIN SLIPThe quicker deliveries, Target executives said, also powered profitability as margins expanded for the first time in nearly three years, rising 30 basis points to 30.6% in the quarter. That reflected a stronger product mix and optimization of pricing, the company said, at a time when Walmart's margins dropped 46 basis points. Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney have all reported disappointing results in the past week.""While many department store peers struggle to sustain positive traffic and stable gross margins, Target is finding the right balance,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.Target's comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.4% as demand for apparel, toys and beauty products rose. Late in the quarter, the retailer also benefited from back-to-school promotions.Its strategy of opening smaller locations in college towns and urban areas, and stocking more own-brand goods, helped store traffic grow 2.4%.Earlier this week, the company said it was starting a new food and beverage brand, Good & Gather, that would hit stores in September. Target expects full-year adjusted profit to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share, up from the prior range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share. The outlook accounted for potential additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.Excluding certain items, it earned $1.82 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 20 cents. Total revenue rose 3.6% to $18.42 billion, above expectations of $18.34 billion. ",1,1
"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- How do you trade an election campaign? is a bit like the old joke about how hedgehogs make love - ""very carefully."" The sad truth is that investors' yearning for certainty is likely to be no more than half-satisfied, even in the most likely scenario.True, the U.K. market outperformed the rest of Europe again on Tuesday, with the FTSE 100 rising 0.1% and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 midcap index rising 0.3%. That’s another tentative sign that investors are turning more positive on what has been the world’s most despised asset class for most of the last four years. The reason? Confidence – at least a relative degree of it – that the Dec. 12 election will produce a Conservative majority in parliament, breaking the deadlock on Brexit and banishing the risk of a hard-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn.Skeptics who argue that a Tory majority has its own risks overlook the increasingly debilitating effect of this endless uncertainty over Brexit. Data out Tuesday showed U.K. mortgage approvals fell to their lowest in seven months, and the Bank of England earlier this month identified the “domestic impact of Brexit-related uncertainties” as one of the chief reasons for a “material” slowdown in the U.K. this year. But the U.K. is still the worst performing market in Europe both this year and on a three-year view, for good reason.A Conservative majority – to which most U.K. bookmakers ascribe a probability between 60%-70%, would almost certainly lead to the country formally leaving the European Union within a month or two. That would finally rule out the prospect of remaining, which the overwhelming majority of economic analysis suggests is the most positive for the U.K.’s long-term economic future. It would not, however, settle the degree to which the U.K. would remain aligned with the EU. Here too, the government’s own analysis sees big variations in long-term economic outcomes, with the most favorable – close alignment with the EU’s standards and trade policy – at odds with a political dynamic pushing for a more distant relationship. By contrast, a Conservative defeat would most likely lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum - another few months of uncertainty in which the optimal long-run outcome is kept alive, but with no guarantee of success.Jim O’Neill, chairman of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said on Tuesday that any relief rally in U.K. assets on the back of a Conservative election win would soon run into headwinds “by February or March”, because the proposed transitional period following Brexit is still set to expire at the end of 2020. That leaves the U.K. with no time to negotiate a comprehensive trading arrangement with the EU.But while the top-down analysis is inevitably still gloomy, the bottom-up effects are much rosier. Individual stocks such as utilities would have the risk of renationalization removed, and all domestic-consumption themed stocks would logically seem poised to benefit from the big increase in budget spending that the Tories are promising to cushion the Brexit blow.The bottom line: nothing is certain, and everything is possible. Nice if you like to trade risk, but still a horrendous backdrop for seeking long-term value.",0,0

"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A recovery rally in European stocks gathered pace for a second day on Thursday after investors brushed off a spike in U.S. inflation, turning their focus back to company earnings from heavy hitters including Europe's largest aerospace firm, Airbus.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.8 percent by 0933 GMT, hitting its highest level in a week. The main European stock index was still down 6.5 percent from its 2 1/2-year peak hit as recently as Jan. 23.Cyclical sectors drove the market higher, with basic resources, industrials, banks and technology stocks the best performers, recovering from their sharp drop last week.The rapid recovery from a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation reported on Wednesday took some by surprise, and investors said the bounce back indicated underlying strength in the market. ""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.""Earnings took center stage once more, with strong results driving the top gainers Airbus,  Ipsen  (PA:IPN),  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).Airbus (PA:AIR) shares jumped 8.8 percent after Europe's largest aerospace firm beat profit and earnings expectations, though it booked a new 1.3 billion euro charge on its A400M military plane.Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) was a top CAC 40 gainer, up 5 percent after the electrical equipment producer reported a strong profit margin despite headwinds from the rise in the euro.Shares in Dutch insurer Aegon (AS:AEGN) gained 3.7 percent after the firm reported a doubling of quarterly net income and raised estimates for future earnings, thanks to a tax cut in the U.S. where it does around 60 percent of its business.Insurer  NN Group  (AS:NN) fared less well than its rival Aegon. The Dutch firm's shares fell 3 percent after it reported profit undershooting analysts' expectations. Another notable faller was Nestle (S:NESN) whose shares hit a 10-month low, down 2.4 percent after the Swiss food giant reported last year's organic growth was the weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996.Meanwhile bank and insurance firm  Old Mutual  (L:OML), and mining company  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose to the top of Britain's FTSE 100 after President Jacob Zuma resigned in South Africa, sending the rand to near three-year highs.Both firms derive a high proportion of their revenue in South Africa, where the parliament was set to confirm Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president later on Thursday.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm, embroiled in an accounting scandal, said it would hold its annual shareholders' meeting on April 20.Overall fourth-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the previous year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.""Earnings estimates have also been raised, so that's definitely one of the supporting factors of the rally,"" said Robeco's Daalder.

"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese mobility venture has unveiled two adapted vans, one which can serve as a workspace or a mobile shop, and another that pumps fresh air through the vehicle to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading between passengers. It is the first commercial offering from Monet, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp (T:9434) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). In one version, the adapted Toyota Hiace van takes in outside air and circulates it through the interior, which is also fitted with screens and curtains to limit virus transmission. It can seat eight passengers in the back. The other version of the van allows users to fix fittings to the floor and arrange the interior as a shop or work space.The Monet joint venture was first announced in October 2018 with the goal of becoming a platform for driverless services. Neither design incorporates self-driving technology and, in the case of the multi-purpose design, Japan's road rules require fittings such as tables to be stored before moving off. The venture hopes to sell 100 units in Japan to customers from government and companies this financial year. Monet is the first alliance between Japan's largest automaker and its No.3 wireless carrier and has attracted support from other domestic automakers as the industry races to develop autonomous vehicles and services.

"By Daina Beth SolomonMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed used-car platform Kavak has become Mexico's first tech ""unicorn"" after reaching a $1.15 billion valuation in its latest funding round last month, Chief Executive Carlos Garcia told Reuters.The Mexico City-based startup has raised over $400 million in total funding since its founding four years ago, with Japan's SoftBank, Hong Kong's DST Global and U.S.-based Greenoaks Capital leading the recent round, Garcia said in an interview on Wednesday.The company is SoftBank's most recent Latin American investment to become a unicorn - lingo for tech startups valued at more than $1 billion - after delivery app Loggi and gym membership app Gympass, both from Brazil, and Colombian delivery app Rappi.Japanese tech investor Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) last year vowed to deploy $5 billion in the region, which Mexican investors praised as a potential game changer for young companies that struggle to fundraise locally.""It's really humbling for us to be the first Mexican unicorn. It's something really important for the ecosystem in Latin America, and especially Mexico,"" Garcia, 37, said.Kavak, an online platform for buying and selling secondhand cars with operations in Mexico and Argentina, is laying plans to launch in Brazil early next year, Garcia said.Kavak entered Argentina in August through its merger with used-car platform Checkars.After building the business gradually in Mexico, Garcia said he aims to scale up faster in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, with plans to hire 500 people within a year. Kavak employs some 800 people in Mexico and Argentina, a workforce that Garcia says will nearly double next year.Despite the hit of the coronavirus crisis, Garcia said traffic has recovered to pre-pandemic levels as shoppers become more comfortable with e-commerce and seek alternatives to public transportation.He expects Kavak to turn a profit in the next couple of years, and going public is in his sights, too.""A route to do an IPO is in our plans... probably in the next two to three years we'd think about doing that,"" he said. ",1,1

The world's two largest economies are trying to meet a March 1 deadline to resolve their trade disputes.The comments countered some economic optimism following an unexpected drop in weekly initial jobless claims.The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. fell to the lowest level since 1969 last week.

"By Tim Hepher and Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 exactly three years ago. France's BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada. The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 metres below the surface and just a metre away from a hidden crevasse.The probe focused on the fan hub at the centre of a 3-metre-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:RTX).The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators - the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency - to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes.""Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,"" the BEA said.Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight. Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce (L:RR).A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part ""cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service"".Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures. The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure. In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue.During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report.At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's telecoms companies could be fined up to 10% of turnover or 100,000 pounds ($133,140) a day if they contravene a ban on using equipment made by China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under a new law put forward on Tuesday.The Telecommunications (Security) Bill will boost the security standards of the UK's telecoms networks and remove the threat of high-risk vendors, the government said.Britain in July decided to ban the use of Huawei in 5G networks from the end of 2027 because of concerns that U.S. sanctions on chip technology meant the Chinese company would not be a reliable supplier.The bill aims to enshrine that decision in law and manage any risks from other high-risk vendors in the future, with tough penalties for telecom companies that break the rules.Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the benefits of 5G and fibre networks could only be realised if they were secure and resilient.""This groundbreaking bill will give the UK one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world and allow us to take the action necessary to protect our networks,"" he said.Huawei said it was disappointed that the government was looking to exclude it from the roll-out of 5G.""This decision is politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks,"" said Vice President Victor Zhang.""It does not serve anyone's best interests as it would move Britain into the digital slow lane and put at risk the Government's levelling up agenda.""The government said the tougher security standards in the bill would also help protect Britain from potential cyber attacks from countries and criminals.Regulator Ofcom will be given the duty of monitoring and assessing the security of telecoms providers.

"By Katanga Johnson(Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc has agreed to pay a $180 million penalty to settle accounting fraud charges for ""intentionally and materially"" overstating its 2019 revenue and understating a net loss, U.S. regulators said on Wednesday.The U.S. Securities and Commission (SEC) fine on the China-based rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) comes after it said earlier this year that much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, sending its shares plunging and sparking an investigation by China's securities regulator and the SEC. The SEC said it found that Luckin ""intentionally and materially overstated its reported revenue and expenses and materially understated its net loss in its publicly disclosed financial statements in 2019.""Luckin has not admitted or denied the charges, the SEC said. The company has agreed to pay the penalty, which may be offset by certain payments it makes to its security holders in connection with its provisional liquidation proceeding in the Cayman Islands.“This settlement with the SEC reflects our cooperation and remediation efforts, and enables the company to continue with the execution of its business strategy,” Dr. Jinyi Guo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Luckin Coffee said in a statement.“The Company’s Board of Directors and management are committed to a system of strong internal financial controls, and adhering to best practices for compliance and corporate governance,” Guo added.The transfer of funds to the security holders will be subject to approval by Chinese authorities.""Public issuers who access our markets, regardless of where they are located, must not provide false or misleading information to investors,"" SEC Director of Enforcement Stephanie Avakian said in a statement.""While there are challenges in our ability to effectively hold foreign issuers and their officers and directors accountable to the same extent as U.S. issuers and persons, we will continue to use all our available resources to protect investors when foreign issuers violate the federal securities laws,"" she said.Founded in June 2017, Luckin had one of the most successful U.S. IPOs by a Chinese company last year, attracting interest from prominent U.S. investors, including long-only funds and hedge funds.But Luckin said in early April that as much as 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million) in sales last year were fabricated by its Chief Operating Officer Jian Liu and other staff, who had been suspended while the company carried out its investigation.The falsified numbers equate to about 40% of Luckin’s annual sales projected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.The Xiamen-headquartered company, which delisted from Nasdaq at the end of June due to the accounting scandal, used related parties to create false sales transactions through three separate purchasing schemes, the SEC alleged.""Luckin employees attempted to conceal the fraud by inflating the company’s expenses by more than $190 million, creating a fake operations database, and altering accounting and bank records to reflect the false sales,"" the agency found.Further, the SEC alleges that during the period of the fraud, Luckin raised more than $864 million from debt and equity investors.

"You might not yet have heard the name Mene (Vancouver: MENE), but you could soon enough, especially if you’re in the market for fine jewelry, explains Frank Holmes, CEO & chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors and editor of Frank Talk.Founded in 2017 by Roy Sebag, co-founder of gold financial services firm Goldmoney, and Diana Widmaier-Picasso, granddaughter of — you guessed it —Pablo Picasso, Mene’s mission is to disrupt the gold jewelry market by selling directly to the consumer and pricing its merchandise fairly and transparently.Unlike traditional sellers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Cartier, which sometimes have high premiums, Mene prices its jewelry based on the changing value of gold.It then charges a 15 percent to 20 percent design and production fee on top of that. What also sets the company apart is that its jewelry—from earrings to necklaces, bracelets to charms—is made of 24-karat gold or platinum. No alloys, no insets of diamonds or other stones.That’s done to help the pieces retain their value over time. Here at U.S. Global Investors, we believe gold is money and a timeless investment. Mene, which takes its name from the Aramaic word for “money,” has clearly run with that idea, going so far as to trademark the phrase “investment jewelry.”It’s a business model that seems to have resonated with consumers and investors alike.

"By Sharon BernsteinSACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present.In a report to state regulators https:// PG&E said it would also remove 375,000 trees near electricity lines, trim vegetation over 2,500 square miles (6,475 square km) and conduct thousands of inspections to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.PG&E is under intense scrutiny for its role in sparking more than a dozen wildfires over the past two years. It filed bankruptcy last month, citing anticipated liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off November's deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people. The San Francisco-based utility, which serves 16 million customers, said it would increase nearly tenfold its efforts to turn off the power to communities threatened by wildfire, increasing the number of households and businesses potentially affected by fire-prevention blackouts in 2019 to 5.4 million.Such shutoffs were also used last year to keep live electricity in the lines from setting off a fire when high winds and heat hit extreme levels and nearby brush or trees could be ignited. Mark Toney, who directs the utility consumer advocacy group the Utility Reform Network (TURN), said shutting off power would harm vulnerable people, including those who rely on electricity to power life-saving medical equipment.""The fact that there is such a dramatic expansion of power shutoffs as a strategy to stop wildfires is a sign of PG&E’s failure and mismanagement when it comes to trimming the trees and taking care of the grid,"" he said.PG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said the company would only turn off the power to a community as a last resort to keep people safe.""We understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects the operation of critical facilities, communications systems and much more,"" she said.The company is also on probation in relation to a criminal conviction in the deadly 2010 explosion of one of its natural gas lines in the city of San Bruno near San Francisco.The judge in that case said he would consider the company's wildfire plan in deciding whether PG&E should do more to prevent wildfire. California law requires all investor-owned utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans annually. ",1,2
"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). is adding 400 workers, some of whom will transfer from plants that are at risk of shutting down, to its Chevrolet Corvette factory in Kentucky that’s preparing to produce the next-generation sports car.The largest U.S. automaker will reveal the Corvette on July 18, according to a statement Thursday. GM will be making the jobs available to existing employees, including those from plants that the company has said won’t be allocated new product, according to Pat Morrissey, a spokesman.GM has been taking political heat from the likes of President Donald Trump and Democratic candidates to challenge him, including former Vice President Joe Biden, over plans to stop production at four U.S. plants by early next year. GM’s Chevrolet Cruze factory in Lordstown, Ohio, which is about 500 miles from the Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, stopped operating in March.All 3,000 workers who will be displaced from their current jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio due to the restructuring will be offered transfers to other GM plants, Morrissey said. The Corvette plant probably will be able to fill all 400 jobs with transferring workers, he said.UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who has publicly criticized GM for not adding new products to Lordstown and three other plants, commended the automaker for adding work at the Corvette plant.“We hope to see more of this in the future from GM, which is good for our members, their families, the community, and all of America,” Dittes said.The new Corvette will be the eighth generation of the famed sports car, which began in 1953.(Updates with hiring detail in the fourth paragraph.)",1,2
"By Geert De ClercqPARIS (Reuters) - Since its start as a grocery pushcart, the Fauchon delicatessen has been on the same spot in central Paris for 134 years where it was buffeted by two World Wars, countless mass demonstrations, strikes and riots. Now Fauchon, famous for its eclairs, foie gras, truffles, and fine wines, is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic which has robbed Paris of most of its tourism trade and struck when the store's footfall was already weakened by months of social unrest.In June, Fauchon put its two flagship stores on Place de la Madeleine into receivership and submitted a restructuring plan to court, which will rule by Sept. 15. ""All demonstrations in Paris seem to start or finish at La Madeleine, and each time we need to close shop. Then there were the strikes around Christmas, our peak period, then came Covid, which was the final blow,"" Fauchon executive Justine Klar said.The firm has warned its 107 staff at La Madeleine there will be job cuts and is negotiating redundancy terms with unions. Fauchon hopes to move to cheaper premises in Paris, away from the demonstrations circuit and to focus more on a Parisian clientele than on tourists. It also wants to boost its network of 73 franchises in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, which are not impacted by the receivership.Founded in 1886 by a pushcart fruit and vegetable grocer named Auguste Fauchon, the store is one of several Paris luxury food brands with 19th century roots. Like macaron shop Laduree, hot chocolate specialist Angelina and gourmet traiteur Maxim's, Fauchon competes with LVMH-owned market leader La Grande Epicerie.

"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Airlines are set to lose $84 billion as the coronavirus pandemic reduces revenue by half to mark the worst year in the sector's history, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast on Tuesday.

""Every day of this year will add $230 million to industry losses,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said. The average loss amounts to almost $38 per passenger flown.In 2021, IATA warned losses could hit $100 billion as traffic struggles to recover and airlines slash fares to win business.""Airlines will still be financially fragile in 2021,"" De Juniac said, predicting ""even more intense"" competition.""That will translate into strong incentives for travellers to take to the skies again,"" he added.IATA forecast a rise in 2021 revenue to $598 billion.Airlines are counting the cost of weeks of lost business, a debt pile swollen by bailouts and a diminished demand outlook.Passenger numbers are seen falling to 2.25 billion this year before rising to 3.38 billion in 2021, still more than 25% below 2019 levels.Yields, a proxy for fares, are seen falling 18% this year, contributing to a $241 billion decline in passenger revenue.Cargo, a relatively small share of the overall business, brought some relief as mass plane groundings drove price increases expected to top 30%, IATA said, helping revenue to a near-record $111 billion.Even in markets where COVID-19 infection rates have fallen sharply, airlines still face a patchwork of travel restrictions and wary consumers.A 14-day quarantine for arriving passengers introduced by Britain this week has prompted an angry response and legal threats from the travel industry amid reports that it may be loosened in favour of ""air corridors"" to some destinations.

The Pacific Business Group on Health, whose members include Boeing (NYSE:BA), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), said in a letter addressed to congressional leaders this week that it feared that further consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to higher costs.Physician practices’ revenues have plummeted across the United States since shutdowns were imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as patients stay home except for emergencies. Even before the pandemic, well-funded hospital systems were taking over smaller doctors groups and hospitals to increase market share.PBGH said it fears these larger players will be even better positioned to buy struggling practices coming out of the crisis, raising healthcare prices for employers. The group asked for a year-long M&A ban for any healthcare provider receiving any of the $170 billion government relief approved for the industry. ""Anti-competitive practices are increasingly concerning to large employers. What we’re seeing happening right now is the collapse of independent primary care,"" Elizabeth Mitchell, chief executive officer of PBGH, told Reuters.Politicians and regulators have already been scrutinizing mergers in the hospital industry. The Federal Trade Commission moved to block a merger between two Pennsylvania hospitals in February, on the grounds that consolidation would mean the systems would have fewer incentives to keep costs down.

"By Emily ChowKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's biggest supermarket chain Mydin has removed products labeled palm-oil-free from its stores, its top executive said on Thursday, as part of a campaign by the world's second-largest producer of the oil to protect the commodity's image at home and abroad.The $60 billion world palm oil trade has been the target of environmentalists because of the vast areas of tropical rainforest they say have been cleared to grow the commodity. The European Union this year passed an act to phase out palm oil from renewable fuel by 2030 due to the deforestation concerns.Malaysia, which together with neighbor Indonesia produce about 85% of the world's palm, is considering a law banning all products flaunting non-use of the oil. Malaysia has also launched an international public relations and lobbying offensive to protect the reputation of its key export.Ameer Ali Mydin, managing director of Mydin Mohamed Holdings Bhd [MYMHB.UL], said his stores removed all anti-palm products on Wednesday to convey the importance of palm oil to the Malaysian economy, Southeast Asia's third biggest.""We must support palm oil but must also make sure (to counter) the subtle messages, the marketing and branding exercises that people do, to tell customers not to take palm oil,"" Ameer Ali told reporters at an event.""By labeling something that there is no palm oil, you're actually telling people that palm oil is bad for you.""He said the anti-palm products at his chain were imported, but declined to give any figures.Teresa Kok, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, welcomed Mydin's move and told reporters she hoped other supermarkets and shops in the country would follow suit. In July, the Malaysian government promised action against an international school for spreading ""anti-palm oil propaganda"".Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, last month told some retailers in the capital Jakarta to remove food products with ""palm oil-free"" labels from their shops.Palm oil is used in cooking and in items like soaps and shampoo, snack foods, pizza, bread and biodiesel. Food accounts for nearly 70% of global consumption of palm oil. ",1,2
"By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - That little tab on the rear pocket of your Levi's jeans is now the subject of a lawsuit.Levi Strauss & Co on Friday sued the French luxury house Kenzo, accusing the unit of LVMH (PA:LVMH) of trademark infringement for putting tabs on its pants pockets, including in a new clothing line featuring singer Britney Spears.The complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where Levi is based, said Kenzo's activities threaten to cause Levi to lose sales and suffer ""incalculable and irreparable damage"" to its goodwill, and confuse shoppers.Kenzo did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours. A lawyer for the Paris-based company could not immediately be located.Levi said it has put distinctive tabs bearing its name, in the form of folded cloth ribbons, in the seams of its pants pockets since 1936, to provide ""sight identification"" for its products.It said Kenzo has not complied with its cease-and-desist letters to stop selling its own clothing bearing similar tabs, including in its ""Kenzo presents Britney Spears-La Collection Memento No. 2"" line launched last month.The complaint quoted Leo Christopher Lucier, Levi's national sales manager in 1936, as having said ""no other maker of overalls can have any other purpose in putting a colored tab on an outside patch pocket, unless for the express and sole purpose of copying our mark, and confusing the customer.""Levi is seeking to recoup lost profits, compensatory and punitive damages, and halt further infringements.The case is Levi Strauss & Co v Kenzo Paris USA LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02106.

"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) stock rose to its highest in nearly three years on Wednesday after chief executive Tim Hoettges looked forward to a potentially massive unlocking of value in a U.S. investment that has languished for years.The decision earlier this month by a New York District Court removing the last obstacles to the merger of its T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) unit with Sprint (NYSE:S) has transformed the investment case for that unit and, in doing so, has materially improved the investment case for the parent.Instead of being the permanently-squeezed fourth-largest player in the U.S., aggressively discounting to gain market share, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is now going to be comparable in size to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), with enhanced pricing power in a market dominated by three large players rather than four (at least, that’s the logic: Telekom’s margins in Germany haven't improved much since a similar concentration resulting from Vodafone’s acquisition of Liberty Global’s local assets).After years of waiting for the merger to be cleared, investors have largely forgotten that story. According to Reuters, Hoettges said the 'new' T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion, less than half the value of either of the big two.""That is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,"" Hoettges said in prepared remarks.The German giant is set to have 42% of the new T-Mobile/Sprint venture. Even at a more conservative valuation of $200 billion, that would still imply an equity value of $84 billion for DT’s share – more than Telekom's entire market capitalization at today’s prices. Even allowing for the high cost of building out 5G networks in both the U.S. and Europe, and even allowing for the fact that net debt, at 2.65 times EBITDA, is still above AT&T’s, it would seem churlish not to ascribe any value to Telekom’s non-U.S. business. In the year just finished, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow were all clearly higher. Stripped of one-off factors, the bottom line grew by 8.9% percent to 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion). A dividend yield of 3.6% is respectable enough, even if slower core earnings growth ahead leaves little promise of big increases.Telekom has been the slowest of slow burners for many years. Even now, the stock is still short of its 2017 peak and below where it was as far back as 2004. But with the road ahead of T-Mobile finally clear, the prospects look as good as at any time in that period.",1,1
"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. retreated to a four-month low in Hong Kong after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker.The shares slumped as much as 7.9% on Monday, adding to their 25% loss for the month. Also listed in Shanghai, SMIC’s stock there retreated as much as 5.8% to the lowest level since its July debut. U.S. firms must now apply for a license to export certain products to the chipmaker, the Commerce Dept. said in a letter dated Sept. 25, reviewed by Bloomberg News. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.Read more: U.S. Imposes Restrictions on Exports to China’s Top ChipmakerThe U.S. stopped short of placing SMIC on the so-called entity list, which means the restrictions are not yet as severe as those imposed on China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Still, the ruling against the chipmaker marks a further escalation in the tensions between the world’s two most powerful countries that have already ensnared other Chinese tech companies including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.“The restriction, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC’s existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “Without steady supply and service from the U.S., the yield and quality of SMIC’s capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes.”SMIC has not received an official notice of the sanctions, has no relationship with the Chinese armed forces and does not manufacture goods for any military end-users or uses, the Shanghai-based company said in an emailed statement over the weekend. The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing didn’t immediate respond Monday to a request for comment on the latest U.S. export restrictions.The SMIC ruling was a compromise between the Departments of Defense and Commerce and moderates in the Trump administration, according to one person familiar with the negotiations. The U.S. has reportedly said it was mulling a more severe blacklisting on SMIC -- akin to the ones imposed on Huawei -- that would affect exports from a broader set of companies.“If SMIC is not included in the Entity List, this could merely be confirmation of the rule change announced on April 27 for ‘civilian end-users’ in U.S.-unfriendly countries,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note. “Instead of a blanket ban, the U.S. will have sole discretion on what US companies can sell to SMIC.” The brokerage had previously estimated that as much as 50% of SMIC’s equipment is from the U.S.A formal statement that includes details of the restriction may be released by the U.S. Commerce Department Monday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said. There will be a comment period of 30 days before the ruling takes effect, with semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups expected to push back against the restrictions, analysts including Atif Malik wrote in a note.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",0,0
"By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON (Reuters) - More investors who typically make passive bets flexed their muscles last year and helped push a total of 922 companies to perform better by improving operations and capital allocation, data from research group Activist Insight show.The data show that 922 companies were approached last year compared with 856 companies approached in 2017 by investors who had ideas on how management could run the business better or who asked for board seats.So-called occasional activists were the most pushy last year, contacting 266 companies with public demands, the data show. In 2017 they reached out to 240 companies. These investors are typically passive shareholders who try to protect existing investments by demanding improvements at underperforming companies.The numbers also show that only 116 companies were contacted by primary focus activists, the large hedge funds that have made their reputations over the years by pushing for change at companies from Allergan (NYSE:AGN) to Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) ""More entrants into the activism space does limit the options for the big name activists,"" said Josh Black, an analyst at Activist Insight, which tracks activist fund managers and their activities.Activist Insight worked with law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel to compile its annual review.To be sure many primary focus activists like Starboard Value, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Third Point were busy in 2018 targeting companies ranging from Newell Brands to United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) to Campbell Soup. But as a group, primary focus activists targeted only 116 companies in 2018 after having reached out to 121 companies in 2017. This made them the least pushy last year, the data show.And the brand-name activists are still commanding attention from corporate chiefs. Elliott Management, one of the biggest firms to pursue activist strategies, was busier than ever in 2018 and launched 24 new campaigns. And Starboard won 29 seats through negotiated settlements in 2018.Referring to these types of firms who started 2019 on a busy note, Schulte Roth partner Eleazer Klein said pure play activists will always be around and working. ""These people are not going away.""And they will raise money even amid poor returns where the average activist hedge fund lost roughly 11 percent last year. ""Fund raising is certainly more challenging especially when firms are not performing. But I don't think these types of firms will have problems."" ",1,1

"By Pete Schroeder and Imani MoiseWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday the Federal Reserve should not allow  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) to grow in size until the bank replaces Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan.In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Warren said Sloan, a 30-year veteran of Wells, was ""deeply implicated"" in prior bank misconduct and it was untenable for him to remain at the bank as the Fed sought a drastic overhaul of its operations.""The Wells Fargo Board of Directors cannot plausibly claim that it is 'ensuring senior management's ongoing effectiveness in managing the firm's activities' while retaining a CEO that helped oversee this much misconduct,"" she wrote.The Fed took the unprecedented step of ordering the bank to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion in February, saying Wells Fargo had prioritized growth at the expense of proper compliance and risk management. The bank now must convince the Fed it has sufficiently overhauled its policies before it is permitted to grow.Warren has called for Sloan's removal in the past, but she cannot compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. Still, her letter indicated she was ramping up her efforts to oust Sloan, and it marks the latest challenge for the bank in Washington, where Wells Fargo has been working to move past its scandals and rebuild its reputation.Wells Fargo is confident in the steps it has taken so far to satisfy the consent order and is engaged in constructive dialogue with the Fed, spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in response to questions about the letter.A Fed spokesman said the agency had received the letter and would respond.Sloan told analysts during a conference call on Friday that the bank continues to expect the asset cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.Since Sloan took over as CEO in 2016, analysts and investors have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn around the bank. Wells's board has defended its pick, saying Sloan's deep knowledge of the bank was an asset. Most recently, the bank's chair, Betsy Duke, shot down rumors that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former  Goldman Sachs Group  (N:GS) executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn. ""CEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered,"" she said in a statement at the time. Financial analysts do not expect Warren's letter to carry much weight with the Fed or with Wells Fargo's board, but the Fed has given in to Warren's pressure once before. In May, the Fed said it would hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on Wells Fargo, after being urged to do so by the Democratic senator. ""I don't think that political pressure is going to sway the Fed either way,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, noting that President Donald Trump's criticism of rising interest rates have not deterred the regulator from implementing more hikes.

"(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) said on Tuesday it would permanently suspend accounts that violate its policies while tweeting about QAnon, a fringe group that claims ""deep-state"" traitors are plotting against President Donald Trump. Twitter, which announced the change on its Twitter Safety page, said it would not serve content and accounts associated with QAnon in trends and recommendations, and would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform. The suspension, which will be rolled out this week, is expected to impact about 150,000 accounts globally, Twitter said. It said that more than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks for violating the company's rules against spam, platform manipulation and ban evasion.The suspensions will be applied to accounts ""engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension — something we’ve seen more of in recent weeks,"" Twitter said. In online conspiracies, the term ""deep-state"" is used to refer to a combination of elites from the intelligence, political, business and entertainment fields, with QAnon's theories claiming that the ""deep-state"" is at a secret war with Trump.QAnon has also claimed that Democratic Party members are behind international crime rings. The group's content has spread widely on mainstream social media platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Earlier this year, Facebook removed a U.S. network of fake accounts linked to QAnon. Last year, the FBI issued a warning about ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists"" and designated QAnon as a potential domestic extremist threat. ",0,0

"By Joshua Franklin and David French(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) has held discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a deal that would allow it to debut in the stock market, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The discussions show that going public is solidly in the sights of SoFi's CEO, Anthony Noto. A former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) investment banker and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s ex-chief operating officer, Noto succeeded SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, who stepped down in 2018. Noto said last year that going public was in the company's long-term plans, but had cautioned it was not a priority.The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at $4.8 billion in a private fundraising round last year, has held talks with a number of so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the sources said, cautioning there is no certainty an agreement would be reached. The sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. SoFi did not respond to requests for comment.A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an initial public offering with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger. SPACs have emerged as one of Wall Street's most popular investment vehicles in 2020, with 208 SPACs raising more than $70 billion so far this year, according to SPAC Research. United Wholesale Mortgage and Finance of America were among the mortgage lenders that agreed to go public this year through SPACs.Founded in 2011, SoFi capitalized on the retrenchment of banks from large swaths of consumer lending in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It started with refinancing student loans and expanded into mortgages and personal loans. The company said in October it had received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in its application for a national bank charter.

"(Reuters) - Golar LNG (O:GLNG) said on Tuesday  Hygo Energy Transition Ltd  (O:HYGO) Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Antonello has taken leave of absence with immediate effect, following a corruption investigation involving him in Brazil.Golar said Antonello's leave was in no way linked to any action or misconduct during his tenure at Hygo Energy, a liquefied natural gas transport and infrastructure operator formed with U.S. private equity firm Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.Antonello's functions will be taken over temporarily by Hygo's board, Golar said.Last Thursday, Brazilian federal prosecutors accused Antonello of bribery in court filings outlining a new phase of the massive Car Wash graft probe, following which debut trading in Hygo was suspended.As part of the latest phase of the probe, a corruption investigation that in six years has led to the jailing of two former Brazilian presidents and hundreds of executives and politicians, Brazilian and Dutch police executed dozens of search warrants on Wednesday.The probe looks into three contracts worth $2.7 billion signed between Sapura and state-run oil firm Petrobras (SA:PETR4) in 2011. Sapura was formed in 2011 as a JV in Brazil between offshore oil rig company  Seadrill  Ltd (OL:SDRL) and Malaysia's Sapura Energy Bhd .Antonello worked for Seadrill at the time Sapura was formed and was responsible for establishing the company's Brazilian operations.

"(Reuters) - Hard-drive maker  Western Digital  Corp (O:WDC) said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit would come in sharply below analysts' expectations and that its chief executive officer would retire soon, sending its shares down 10%.The San Jose-based company expects its second-quarter adjusted profit to come in between 45 cents and 65 cents per share, compared with analysts' forecasts of 75 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The company's gloomy outlook overshadowed its estimate-beating first-quarter numbers, setting its shares for the worst session in a year if losses hold.After the closing bell of trading on Wednesday, Western Digital posted a revenue of $4.04 billion and adjusted profit of 34 cents per share for first quarter ended Oct. 4, beating analysts' expectations of $3.93 billion and 30 cents per share.However, Western Digital forecast its second-quarter operating expenses to be between $750 million and $770 million on an adjusted basis, compared with analysts' expectations of $741.8 million.""When you move into the first half of the year, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that we will see atypical seasonal decline in terms of some demand perspective. Supply is relatively linear,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Milligan said in a post earnings call with analysts.""And so we will have to, just like we do every -- largely every year in terms of the calendar cyclicality, we'll have to manage through that.""In a separate note, the company said Milligan would retire soon but will continue to serve as CEO until the board appoints a successor.

"By Jesús AguadoMADRID (Reuters) - Santander (MC:SAN) Brazil head Sergio Rial will join Santander's board as a group executive director, the Spanish bank said on Thursday, giving the 59-year-old more influence over its overall strategy.The Brazilian is viewed as one of the leading candidates to become Santander CEO in the medium term, several senior bankers have told Reuters, after the bank failed to hire Italian banker Andrea Orcel for the role in January last year.""It is very clear that Santander's next candidate for ... CEO should be someone from within the bank and Rial is a clear frontrunner,"" one investment banker, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.Santander, the euro zone biggest bank in terms of market value, said on Thursday that it would not comment on ""mere speculation"" when asked about candidates for the post of CEO.The Madrid-based bank also said that Rial would continue to report to its chief executive Jose Antonio Alvarez.

"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Cecchini, Wall Street’s biggest equity bear, has been humbled but not convinced by the market rally.In a week when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, the global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 2,500 from 2,390. The new forecast represents a 15 percent drop from the current level, still putting him as the most pessimistic among 25 strategists tracked by Bloomberg.Stocks have surged this year, sending the S&P 500 up 17 percent, as investors jubilate over a dovish Federal Reserve and bet a profit slowdown will be short-lived. Such optimism is misplaced, according to Cecchini.“We do not foresee an inflection in U.S. economic growth or S&P earnings growth in the second half as global growth continues to slow and costs rise,” he said. “We also do not foresee a Fed cut as likely. With slower growth and a Fed that is slow to cut, we think equities will struggle in the second half.”The reluctance to embrace stocks is echoing sentiment in a market where many see the momentum unlikely to continue given persistent uncertainties over corporate earnings and monetary policy. Hedge funds have largely sat out the rally, while professional forecasters see little room for gains in coming months. The median forecast from strategists points to 2,950 in December, slightly above the S&P 500’s current level of 2,931.Cecchini joined a growing list of prognosticators who have been forced to chase the rally.

"(Bloomberg) -- Turmoil, meet month end. Month end, meet turmoil.The latest bout of risk-off moves in global markets has arrived just as investors prepare to close out the month and quarter. That leaves many with a conundrum: just how much of the current tumult is down to shifting fundamentals, and how much to portfolio rebalancing that usually accompanies the quarter end?The conclusion could be key to everything from the fate of the epic bull market in stocks and the chances of a bear market in bonds to the path charted by the greenback. It’s particularly important to short-term money market rates, which had been grinding higher as the U.S. raises benchmark borrowing costs and the era of easy money nears its end.“Markets have been volatile on alternating headlines and systematic flows in an illiquid trading environment,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists including Marko Kolanovic wrote in note. “While a number of narratives have come out to attempt to explain the recent market weakness, we believe these risks shouldn’t derail the larger positive fundamental forces.”Indeed, fewer players had the chance to exert larger-than-normal downward pressure as the holiday-shortened week sapped the market of its usual trading activity. Over the past eight years when U.S. stocks dropped more than 1 percent, volume on the U.S. tape has hit 8.6 billion trades on average. Tuesday’s session, however, fell about 1 billion short of that norm, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Still U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which had been locked above 2.8 percent for almost two months, finally fell below that threshold late in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Eurodollars advanced by five to seven basis points, while expectations for more Federal Reserve hikes faded.Month-end buying in fixed income did squeeze shorts into the close, according to Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed-income at NatAlliance Securities in New York. Yet that may not be the end of declines in bond yields.Considering everything from lower trending economic data to fading rate hike expectations, it’s likely 10-year yields “get an acceleration through to 2.65-ish” percent before getting to 3 percent, he wrote in a Tuesday note.One sign that rebalancing is at work: The yen was falling against the dollar on Wednesday, belying its usual status as a safe haven in times of trouble. For Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) AG, it’s a reason not to over-read the current moves.“These markets are all sound and fury,” he said in a tweet. “Simply looking for yesterday’s sell-off to continue today is as silly as expecting the Monday rally to continue yesterday.”Beyond the usual quarter-end portfolio tinkering, however, fundamental issues could still weigh on sentiment. Though growth remains strong, the peak in corporate earnings has passed -- and what remains in its place is an era of uneven global expansion, political uncertainty and a shift in market regime, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.“As this unusually synchronized phase ends expect volatility and correlation to rise,” wrote the firm’s global quantitative strategy team, headed by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins. “This does not make us bearish, but reduces the upside from here.”Meanwhile in equities, Tuesday’s declines would appear to be about news rather than portfolio rebalancing. The S&P 500 Index was higher in the middle of the day before a steady stream of negative tech stories dragged some of the biggest companies lower. Even the Nasdaq 100 Index started Tuesday in the green; it ended the day with the biggest drop since February’s rout.U.S. stock futures, including contracts for the Nasdaq, turned positive on Wednesday as tech fears began to ease, while the yen slumped. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell, however, hovering around 2.77 percent.(Updates with Wednesday moves in last paragraph.)",1,1

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) has threatened to close two regional bases and axe up to 120 pilot jobs unless pilots in its home Irish market bypass their union and directly accept a pay cut, a memo seen by Reuters said. Europe's largest low-cost carrier is demanding pay cuts of up to 20% and changes to work practices across Europe.It has said it plans 3,000 job cuts and a reduction in staff unit costs, but faces union resistance in a number of markets. In the memo sent on Friday, Ryanair director of operations Neal McMahon told pilots the union council representing Irish pilots had walked away from talks on Wednesday, something the Forsa trade union denied. McMahon said a union request for an extension of a 30-day consultation on job cuts represented ""stalling tactics"". Instead, the memo sent on the company's internal messaging system, asked pilots to click a button to accept proposals including a 20% pay cut that would be reversed gradually within four years, a spreading of available work via job shares and unpaid leave, and ""productivity improvements"".It said the number of job losses, and whether bases at Cork and Shannon airports remained open would depend on the number of acceptances. A Ryanair spokeswoman said she had ""nothing further to add to that memo"".Trade union Forsa, in a memo to pilots on Friday, said Ryanair's latest proposal was unacceptable as it would effectively leave pilots temporarily on zero-hour contracts and provided no guarantee job losses would be avoided.Forsa said it had requested third-party mediation, but had not received a reply. Ryanair, which is reopening much of its network on July 1, says it needs to cut staff costs to compete with rivals that have received state bailouts.Union representatives have pointed to management comments about expansion opportunities likely to be triggered by the retrenchment of rivals in the wake of COVID-19.

"By April JoynerNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday as quarterly results from banks added to concerns about lower interest rates dampening their profits, while comments from U.S. President Donald Trump on trade also dragged down Wall Street's major indexes.JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) beat quarterly profit estimates but reported weaker net interest income, pointing to rising deposit costs. Those results followed  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) results on Monday, in which the bank reported a drop in its net interest margin.JPMorgan shares erased early losses to end 1.1% higher. Wells Fargo shares, however, slipped 3.0% as the bank tempered its outlook for cutting costs.""The expectation is the yield curve is going to remain flat, so you're going to still continue to see net interest margins compress, and that's going to hurt profitability,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of expected upside to Q3 and Q4.""Stocks also moved lower after Trump said there was a long way to go with China on trade and threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods.The major indexes briefly pared losses after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the U.S. economy humming, but they later moved back to their previous levels.""In a really quiet market, a headline like this has a magnified effect, so even if it's not something investors don't already know, it can move the market with ease,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W.

"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina MandlSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Corruption-ensnared Odebrecht SA has proposed that creditors take over its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, in exchange for reducing Odebrecht's huge debt load, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. The move is the latest sign of the radical way in which Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht, best known for its engineering and construction operations, is remaking itself to renegotiate 70 billion reais in consolidated debt.Accused of bribing politicians and executives to get contracts throughout Latin America, Odebrecht made a deal two years ago with U.S, Brazilian and Swiss authorities, paying a record $3.5 billion in fines to settle charges.Atvos has about 12 billion reais ($3.25 billion) in debt with various lenders, including state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), Caixa Economica Federal and development bank BNDES, as well as private Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11). A debt-for-equity swap would give Atvos more time to recover without selling plants, a potential alternative to paying off debt. Both sources, who requested anonymity because the talks are private, said this week that a sale of Atvos' assets would not be enough to pay off all outstanding debt.The sources added that a final decision has not yet been made regarding a swap and that an agreement to transfer Atvos ownership may not be reached.Atvos is Brazil's second largest ethanol company after Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) and energy firm Cosan (SA:RLOG3).Atvos' net debt is equivalent to about 10 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. By comparison, debt for the sector's best-run companies is double EBITDA or less.In preliminary discussions with creditors, Odebrecht said it wanted lenders to swap most of their debt in Atvos for control of the company, but family-owned company Odebrecht wants to keep a minority stake. The sizes of the stakes have yet to be determined, the sources added. The largest chunk of Atvos debt is held by state-controlled banks, mainly Banco do Brasil and BNDES, one source said. Banco do Brasil, Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter. Odebrecht, Itau and BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The ethanol company has crushing capacity of 37 million tonnes of sugar cane per year, but has been operating at a much lower level due to financial problems. In the 2017/2018 crop, Atvos processed 25.8 million tonnes, according its annual report.Odebrecht hired consultancy Canaplan to assess how much debt Atvos' cash flow could handle, and the firm will present a report to lenders about a new business plan.In November, the corruption-ensnared conglomerate hired advisers to restructure a portion of its bank and bond debt.

"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). gave investors just enough good news Wednesday to let them to breathe a sigh of relief.The shares rallied after the company posted slightly better-than-expected subscriber growth overseas in the third quarter, making up for a far smaller gain at home. Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, helping investors look past a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.After a disappointing quarter three months ago, investors came in with lower expectations this time around. And Netflix cleared that bar, sending the shares up as much as 11% in late trading.“We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The world’s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.3 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Even though domestic subscriptions missed analysts, they at least rebounded from a decline in the previous quarter. Netflix expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months.International markets account for almost all of Netflix’s growth -- and most of its total customers. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts. A new season of “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish heist series, boosted interest abroad, especially in Latin America and Europe.“Stranger Things,” meanwhile, was viewed by 64 million people in its first four weeks, the most-watched series to date. The teen science-fiction show, now in its third season, is the service’s biggest hit at home.Netflix expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than analysts expected. While the final three months of the year are typically among the strongest, the company will face new competition from the Disney+ and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ streaming services.Netflix shares rose as high as $318.79 in extended trading. The stock has taken a beating since July, dropping 21% since last quarter’s miss. It closed at $286.28 in regular trading on Wednesday.U.S. WoesThird-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates of $1.05.This quarter, the company forecasts profit of 51 cents a share on revenue of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.In the U.S., there wasn’t much to cheer about. The company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year. A recent price increase contributed to the slowdown, Netflix said.The company also is bracing for fresh competition this quarter.“The launch of these new services will be noisy,” Netflix said in its letter. “There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.”(Updates with company remarks starting in third paragraph)",1,2

"LONDON (Reuters) - Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) needs more details on British plans to quarantine travellers before it can assess its impact after seeing strong demand for the routes it has started operating, its chief executive told Reuters.Jozsef Varadi, the chief executive of budget Hungarian carrier Wizz, said on Monday that one option to lower the impact of any quarantine would be to make exemptions for those travellers who had recently tested negative for the virus. Britain has announced a new restriction with a 14-day quarantine requirement on most people arriving into the country by air, saying more details including the timing of the programme would come shortly.Varadi said that it would be logical for the government to allow exemptions to the rule if passengers had had a verified negative test for coronavirus in the days prior to travelling, as happens in other countries where Wizz flies which have quarantine rules.

"By Tim Hepher and William JamesPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's decision to suspend tariffs on Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets and other U.S. goods has stunned the planemaker's European rival Airbus and exposes a growing rift between the UK and Europe over aerospace investment, industry sources and analysts said.Britain said on Tuesday it would suspend the tariffs on Jan. 1, describing the move as an attempt to de-escalate a long-running conflict over aircraft subsidies that has dragged the United States and Europe into a tit-for-tat tariff war.The decision comes amid wider trade talks between Britain and the United States and ends a united front on tariffs between Airbus's political backers Britain, France, Germany and Spain.Airbus played down the move, saying the company's goal remains ""to find a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs.""Diplomats say U.S. and EU trade chiefs are in ""serious"" negotiations to end the 16-year-old aircraft trade row.Privately, several European trade sources said the surprise UK move risked the most serious cross-Channel split on aerospace in decades. Two of the sources said it was viewed in other capitals as a ""betrayal"" of Airbus, which has 14,000 UK staff.Paul Everitt, head of UK aerospace lobby group ADS, said Britain had acted unilaterally without reciprocal U.S. action.The subsidy dispute is the largest case ever handled by the World Trade Organization and comes to a head just as Britain is leaving the European Union, forcing it to seek new trade deals.""There have always been disagreements, but this is the first time that statecraft has been put so clearly before shareholder trust,"" said a senior UK industry official.Airbus' biggest shareholders include France, Germany and Spain. Britain is not a shareholder but hosts virtually all Airbus wing production and makes its voice heard indirectly.Several sources said the move would reinforce studies by Airbus to re-examine where to build wings for future jets.""It is really damaging and means the UK can forget about further investment,"" the senior industry official said.""SERIOUS"" TALKSThe decision follows a debate about whether Britain can legally impose tariffs inherited from the EU after Jan. 1 because of its technical status in the WTO case. Legal experts have said it could do so under rules of state succession.Britain insisted the move would help resolve the subsidy spat, which has hit other industries forced to pay tariffs.""We are serious about de-escalation ... this (suspension of tariffs) demonstrates the seriousness we place on reaching a negotiated settlement,"" a UK spokesman said on Wednesday.Several sources said an aircraft agreement could be reached before U.S. President Donald Trump leaves office next month.Even though the United States is likely to welcome Britain dropping tariffs, reaching a deal may be complicated by the fact that Airbus jets are built across European borders.""It is not clear how you resolve the UK part without addressing the rest of Europe,"" a U.S. source said. ""The entire discussion has been structured around finding a whole solution"".The U.S. Trade Representative's office declined comment.Airbus has most plants in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. So far jets assembled at a plant in Alabama are exempt from U.S. tariffs, which are due to be reviewed in January.Barring an agreement, one option on the table is to widen the tariffs to cover parts coming from Europe to Alabama, narrowing access to the U.S. market, two sources said. ",1,2
"By Kate DuguidNEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Cetrulo, a former portfolio manager at Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, is raising funds for a global macro discretionary hedge fund and is targeting a launch in the first quarter of 2019, two sources familiar with the situation said.Entheos Capital Advisors formed its limited partnership in recent weeks, and is in early stage negotiations with potential seed and anchor investors, the sources said.The macro fund - so-called because it bets on macroeconomic events across asset classes - will trade foreign exchange, global fixed income, global equity indices and liquid commodities. As a ""discretionary"" fund, it will construct portfolios based on a top-down, thematic view of global markets.Cetrulo will be the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Entheos, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page. After a decade at Point72, he last worked as a global macro portfolio manager at Balyasny Asset Management. The investment team will include people formerly employed by Cohen's multistrategy firm Point72 as well as Ray Dalio's quantitative macro fund Bridgewater Associates, the sources said.The head of macroeconomic research at Entheos will be Stephen Modelfino, who previously spent six years at Bridgewater, according to the sources.Brian Cassese, a former senior analyst from Cetrulo's time at Point72, will also join the team. Joel Press of hedge fund consultancy Press Management and former head of Ernst and Young's hedge fund practice, will serve as an adviser on the operational side of the business, the sources said.  The fund will employ quantitative macroeconomic strategies and market-based research, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn page. Before February 2018, many discretionary macro hedge funds suffered in the low-volatility post-financial crisis environment. As volatility has returned to the market with the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy and the rise in interest rates, discretionary macro funds have been outperforming the broader category of macro funds.

"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL) on Thursday said it was working to review and evolve its Chinese toothpaste brand, Darlie, the latest in a string of brand reassessments amid a U.S. debate on racial inequality. Darlie is a popular Chinese brand owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner, Hawley & Hazel. Its package features a smiling man in a top hat. It used to be called Darkie and featured a man in blackface.Its current Chinese name still translates to ""black person toothpaste."" The move comes as Corporate America reacts to weeks of protests over racial injustice and police brutality sparked by the death in May of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck. ""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging. We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told Reuters in an email. Colgate's statement to Reuters followed news on Wednesday that PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) was dropping its Aunt Jemima logo, prompting peers to initiate reviews of other food brands featuring African American characters, including Uncle Ben's rice, Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and Cream of Wheat. Darlie controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 45% in Taiwan, according to Euromonitor International. Colgate paid $50 million in 1985 for 50 percent of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darkie.

The euro was barely changed at $1.1023 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was off just 0.02% at 98.129.Higher U.S. Treasury yields also illustrated the risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.845% from a U.S. close of 1.815% on Thursday.The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6101% from 1.593% on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U.S. recession, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.BULLS VS CHINA Government borrowing costs in Germany and France also inched up on Friday, but were set for sizeable weekly declines, in contrast to southern European countries that have come under heavy selling pressure again this week.Germany's 10-year Bund yield was at -0.33%, off more than one-week lows hit on Thursday. But it is down 8 bps on the week, set for the biggest weekly fall since mid-August. Dutch 10-year bond yields are down 7 bps this week, and French yields are 5 bps lower,.Data on Thursday had showed Germany's economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter, with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction and a technical recession of two quarters of economic shrinkage.""In general, there has been risk aversion in recent days and a shift to core bond markets from the periphery,"" said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at DZ Bank.Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16-month-long trade war. China's commerce ministry said the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions on the first-phase trade pact, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal.China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, which the U.S. Trade Representative said would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have U.S. President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to.The new record for the S&P, which gained just 0.08% to 3,096.63, came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty.In commodity markets, U.S. crude prices seesawed after sliding Thursday on rising U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude stumbled from $57.02 to $56.67 a barrel.Global benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.5% to just below $62 per barrel on the way to a modest weekly fall.Gold retreated from gains that had been prompted by trade uncertainty. Spot gold was last trading at $1,463.90 per ounce, down 0.48%.  ",1,2
"By Laurence Frost and Toby SterlingPARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM's (PA:AIRF) French unions on Monday criticised calls by their Dutch counterparts for KLM to be given greater autonomy, amid signs that a multibillion-euro coronavirus bailout is increasing tensions within the airline group.""It's an illusion to think KLM would fare better without Air France,"" the French carrier's unions said in an open letter responding to comments last week by Dario Fucci, head of the KLM works council.France agreed last month to issue or guarantee 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in loans to Air France, with another 2-4 billion pledged to KLM by the Dutch government.But the rescue package, designed to see the group through the virus pandemic that has crippled the global airline sector, also stoked concern in the Netherlands over possible French nationalisation in a later capital increase.The French and Dutch governments each own close to 14% of Air France-KLM, which declined to comment on the exchange of barbs between its unions.In Dutch media interviews, the KLM union chief suggested the relationship between the airlines and the combined Air France-KLM holding company should be loosened in response to the ""exploding"" debt on the Air France side.""The prenuptial agreement will have to change,"" Fucci was quoted as saying in De Telegraaf newspaper. ""We want to buy fuel and sell tickets together, but that's the end of it.""The response from Air France colleagues was backed by nine of their unions including the main SNPL pilots' grouping.""When Air France bought KLM in 2004, KLM was nearly bankrupt,"" their open letter said on Monday.Since then, it added, ""KLM has experienced exponential growth, taking full advantage of access to the French market, which ... remains one of the largest, most attractive and most lucrative in the world."" The riposte came as Dutch lawmakers were preparing on Tuesday to discuss government plans to contribute up to 4 billion euros in direct and state-guaranteed loans for KLM.The bailout was announced after Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith, who has pushed in vain for closer integration between the two airlines, gave up his 2020 bonus under Dutch government pressure.

"By Humeyra PamukWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has warned top American companies including Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL)and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) over risks faced from maintaining supply chains associated with human rights abuses in China's western Xinjiang region, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday.""It is critical that U.S. companies and individuals be aware of the large-scale human rights abuses perpetrated by the PRC government in Xinjiang,"" Keith Krach, Undersecretary of State for economic growth, energy and the environment wrote on July 1.""Businesses should evaluate their exposure to the risks that result from partnering with, investing in, and otherwise providing support to companies that operate in or are linked to Xinjiang,"" he said in the letter which was sent to trade groups.The United States is seeking to ratchet up pressure on China at a time of heightened tensions over that country's treatment of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang and Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong.On Wednesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory saying companies doing business in Xinjiang or with entities using Xinjiang labor could be exposed to ""reputational, economic, and legal risks"".The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. China has denied mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and help fight extremism.When asked about U.S. government warnings over supply chain risks linked to Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that allegations of forced labour were fabrications.""Some people in the U.S. keep on saying they care about ethnic minorities in Xinjiang while also taking all kinds of measures to oppress Xinjiang companies,"" he said at a daily news conference in Beijing. He said this showed their hypocrisy and desire to suppress Xinjiang's development. In a call with reporters, Krach said the complex nature of supply chains was making companies vulnerable to potential risks and urged them to be more vigilant. He did not say how many U.S. companies might have been entangled in such supply chains.  ",0,0

"By Ritvik CarvalhoLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks drifted lower on Friday as the latest exchange of trade threats between the United States and China dampened risk appetite, while Italian bonds and shares in the country's banks sold off on signs of renewed government tensions in Rome.The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down by 0.1 percent after the start of European trading, and set to break a four-week streak of gains.While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent, though it was down over half a percent on the week.The trade row between the world's top two economies intensified midweek after President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent U.S. tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing vowed to retaliate.Investors were also cautious before the July U.S. jobs report due later in the day. This will give a reading on the health of the world's largest economy, now in its second longest expansion on record. Economists polled by Reuters expect 190,000 jobs were created in July.""The stock market trend continues to be characterized by a struggle between trade war distress, growth risks and strong corporate Q2 reports,"" SEB strategists wrote in a note to clients.According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year.Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit its highest in over three weeks, extending sharp gains made the previous day, while the euro fell to its lowest level since the end of June. Investors said the greenback was benefiting from safe haven flows.Italian two-year and five-year government bond yields rose about 22 to 25 basis points to 1.27 percent and 2.32 percent in early trade, hitting their highest levels since early June. Italian bank stocks fell 0.8 percent, set for their worst week since early June. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is under pressure from within the government to raise spending and challenge European Union budget rules.The possibility that he might be forced to resign has investors worried that Italy could go on a spending binge, or even that fresh elections could follow. That in turn could strengthen the hand of the eurosceptic League party and its leader, Matteo Salvini. The two- and five-year bonds have been most sensitive to concern over the chance of an Italian exit from the euro, which would increase default risk on debt coming due soon. ""Clearly, this is about the fear that Tria gets kicked out, which could lead to a collapse of the government, new elections, and the League gaining even further,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Christoph Rieger. ""Or it may mean that they agree on a budget that's at odds with the EU,"" he said, adding that this would imply heavier borrowing and greater bond supply.Yields on 10-year bonds also rose, by 9 basis points, to hit 3 percent for the first time since June 11, and the closely watched spread over Germany was at its widest since late June at 257 bps,. [GVD/EUR]With the trade tensions encouraging demand for safe haven assets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield pulled back to 2.9767 percent from a 10-week high above 3 percent brushed midweek. [US/]The 10-year Treasury yield had hit the peak partly due to a surge in Japanese government bond yields to 1-1/2-year highs this week as the market tested the Bank of Japan's rejigged policy framework, under which it now allows yields to fluctuate in a wider band.Oil prices eased back slightly after the previous day's rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. [O/R]Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent at $73.17 a barrel after surging 1.5 percent on Thursday.Copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped half a percent to $6,107 per tonne.

Hyundai last reported sales lower than this in February 2010.South Korea's Hyundai, which with affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) is the world's No.5 car maker, is the first major automaker to announce sales for the month. Chinese and U.S. players will turn in their numbers in the coming weeks. The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has killed nearly 3,000 and roiled global financial markets as investors and policymakers brace for a steep knock to world growth. South Korea has the most cases of infections outside the mainland, with the total at 4,212, affecting companies like Hyundai and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).""Inside South Korea is now more urgent than China,"" Korea Investment & Securities analyst Kim Jin-woo wrote in a note. ""With sluggish consumption affecting demand on top of it all, means auto sales are certain to be hit in the first quarter, and the impact expected to continue until at least the beginning of the second quarter."" Hyundai was the first major automaker to flag a hit to its manufacturing outside China when it halted production at home, its biggest manufacturing base, in February due to a shortage of parts from China.While the automaker has gradually resumed output, virus-related uncertainties remain. Just last week, a worker at its factory complex in the southeastern South Korean city of Ulsan tested positive for the virus, prompting it to shut a factory. The plant, which makes popular models such as the Palisade sport utility vehicle, resumed production on Monday, a Hyundai spokesman said.

"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that he made a ""large"" bet on insurer Brighthouse Financial late last year, and had made money on General Motors (NYSE:GM) but lost by shorting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought into Brighthouse, MetLife's former U.S. retail life-insurance business, at an average cost of $57.92, according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters. The stock is now trading at $63.90.The fund manager said General Motors, which was his firm's biggest winner last year, remains ""significantly under valued"" given the automaker's ""impressive fundamental performance.""But Einhorn also said he again lost money by betting that a group of fast-growing technology stocks, including Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla, would fall. ""The biggest losers for the year were our short positions on the 'bubble basket',"" Einhorn wrote.Greenlight Capital, whose annualized 15.4 percent return over more than two decades make it one of the world's most closely watched hedge funds, posted only a modest return in 2017. The firm's 1.6 percent gain trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 21.8 percent gain and Einhorn said it was a tough year for so-called value investors like himself.""While it feels like we have been running face first into the wind, we don't intend to capitulate and are sticking to our strategy of being long (on) misunderstood value and shorting 'not value',"" he wrote.Greenlight made money on German energy company Uniper and performance chemicals business Chemours, and took new stakes in offshore rigs operator Ensco and social media company Twitter.Time Warner was bought again because Greenlight thinks the planned merger with AT&T (NYSE:T) will go through. And if it doesn't, ""TWX has several strategic options to create value,"" said Einhorn.Einhorn was candid about his losses, noting that his bet on pharmacy retailer Rite Aid, in which he invested at $7.45 a share, did not turn out the way he expected. He exited at $2.78 a share.Greenlight is still betting that the price of gold will rise, but Einhorn said the firm lost money on the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and got out.

"By John IrishPARIS (Reuters) - Hungary's foreign minister on Thursday accused major Western European nations of ""hypocrisy"" and ""hysteria"" for criticizing central European countries' business dealings with China, and defended Hungary's use of Huawei 5G mobile phone technology.Sixteen central and eastern European countries, including 11 European Union members, held a summit with China in April during which it pledged to increase trade and provide more support for big cross-border infrastructure projects.The area is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.France and Germany oppose such independent moves, which they fear might make Europe appear disunited at a time when the EU is trying to forge a more defensive strategy towards China.On Tuesday, speaking to reporters in Paris, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticized ""negotiations of 16 states from the east with China in parallel to negotiations that the EU is leading with China"".But Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto rejected such criticism, saying Germany and France do far more business with China than the central European states, and often negotiate directly with Beijing.""There is such a bad hypocrisy in the European Union when it comes to China,"" Szijjarto told Reuters on the sidelines of an OECD meeting in Paris. ""The 11 central and eastern European member states ... represent 9.9 percent of EU trade with China.""""When the German chancellor and French president meet China's leadership nobody thinks that's a problem,"" he said. ""Nobody raises a question about how it is possible that they sell 300 aircraft to China, which is a bigger deal than the (entire) trade represented by the 11 central European countries."" He said it was also unfair for Western European states to criticize Hungary for using technology from Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G mobile phone networks, when those networks were being built under license by German and British companies, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD).The United States and some of its European allies are pushing countries to exclude Huawei technology from their infrastructure, arguing that the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker could pose a security threat. Huawei denies that its technology could be misused by the Chinese state. The Hungarian mobile phone licenses were ""signed by the biggest German and British telecommunications companies, and then the Germans, British and French accuse us of opening up our market to Huawei,"" Szijjarto said.""When it comes to China it's a matter of competition. Instead of crying, instead of making hysteria and accusing central European countries, we should strengthen ourselves and be ready for the competition."" ",1,2

"LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) is to assume direct leadership of the British retailer's troubled clothing business after sacking the division's boss.Jill McDonald, clothing, home & beauty managing director, is leaving the business after less than two years in the job, M&S said on Thursday. Group CEO Steve Rowe will take over the leadership of the division directly in the near term, it added.""The business now needs to move on at pace to address long-standing issues in our clothing and home supply chain around availability and flow of product,"" said Rowe.""Given the importance of this task to M&S I will be overseeing this program directly.""Rowe did praise McDonald for strengthening the clothing team, improving the quality and style of product and setting a clear direction for the business to attract a younger family age customer.McDonald joined M&S in October 2017 to take on one of the biggest jobs in British fashion, having previously been the chief executive of bicycles and car parts company Halfords (L:HFD). Her appointment raised questions from some because she had no clothing retail experience.After several failed relaunches over the past decade, the jury is out on whether the 135-year-old M&S can rise to the challenges posed by fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M in its clothing business.M&S set out its latest turnaround plan shortly afterretail veteran Archie Norman became chairman in September 2017 to work alongside Rowe, who became CEO in 2016 and has been with the company three decades.In May M&S reported a third straight drop in annual profit and its shares are down 30% from a year ago.McDonald was a Rowe hire. On appointment he highlighted her ""fantastic customer insight"" and a wealth of operational, retail and leadership experience developed at Halfords and fast-food giant McDonald's.M&S' clothing and home like-for-like sales fell 1.6% in its 2018-19 year.NOTABLE BY OMISSIONAt the group's annual meeting on Tuesday Rowe said it had been a ""troubled year"" for the clothing and home business.He said M&S had developed a strong team in clothing, name checking 2018 hires Jill Stanton, women's and kid's director, and Wes Taylor, the menswear director for bringing over 60 years clothing experience to the business.However, McDonald's name was notable by omission from Rowe'sspeech.The CEO said that while M&S had improved its clothing ranges in terms of fit, style and value for money it still had significant issues with availability.""I think here we've done much of the hard work on style and fit and it's the process that we need to change,"" Rowe said.""Further work (is needed) on getting size ratios correct, making sure we reduce the number of lines we’re running so we can buy deeper, concentrating on the big lines that we’re famous for across the UK,"" he said.Rowe forecast an improvement by the autumn.Industry publication Drapers reported in June that Topshop fashion director Maddy Evans was leaving the company to join M&S in a senior buying role. M&S declined to comment on that report.",0,0
"(Bloomberg) -- While many investors are getting anxious about the lateness of the economic and market cycle, it’s not yet time to abandon U.S. equities, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).“An increasing chunk of the investor base is of the view that one has to be already positioned for the next downturn,” strategists Mislav Matejka, Prabhav Bhadani and Nitya Saidanha wrote in a note Monday. “We continue to believe that S&P 500 will recoup the October correction, similar to what it achieved post- the February one.”A panoply of negatives has hit the U.S., and global, stocks since the start of October, starting with a rebound in benchmark Treasury yields, which has enhanced the appeal of risk-free investments. Worries over a peak in corporate earnings growth, a continuing escalation of trade tariffs, a slowdown in China’s domestic demand and a cooling in the outlook for technology products -- the iPhone prime among them -- have also dented sentiment.Against that, there’s no sign that the economy is rolling over just yet. And the JPMorgan team cited a series of other reasons not to throw in the towel on American equities:The strategists also took heart from the recent surge in volatility, saying the VIX, or the Cboe Volatility Index, has reached levels where stocks typically did well in subsequent months.Bottom line is the JPMorgan team calls for an “overweight” position in U.S. equities, where “positioning appears relatively light.” It has neutral positions on Europe, where politics remain challenging, and Japan, where a stronger yen could pose a headwind.",1,2

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker said earlier this month that if the law gets enacted, its unification plans would change.""We're not going to speculate on all the many paths this could take, but if there's a high probability that exit would be associated with an 11 billion euro tax bill, obviously that wouldn't be in shareholders' interest,"" Jope said in a presentation broadcast on the internet. ""But personally, I think logic and common sense will prevail.""Unilever, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, is hosting meetings on Sept. 21 in Rotterdam and Oct. 12 in London for shareholders to vote. When asked about the current macroeconomic environment, Jope said a global economic downturn was ""absolutely inevitable but we don't know its depth or how it will play out by country.""He said gross margins could see pressure as its value brands become more popular. Still, the company's North American business is currently seeing ""sustained strength"", driven by hygiene products and food and market share gains online.Moving forward, Jope said Unilever should continue to deliver annual cost savings, grow its revenues and increase its margins, though the margin growth may not be as fast as it was in prior years.

"By Eric Onstad, Christoph Steitz and Esha VaishLONDON/FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (HK:1211) is looking at launching battery production in Europe, joining Asian rivals aiming to cash in on a green car revolution and threatening attempts by Brussels to nurture a home-grown industry.Keen to capture a European car battery value chain that will be worth an estimated 250 billion euros ($290 billion) by 2025, the European Commission launched an alliance of local companies last year aiming to build 10-20 huge battery factories.But only Sweden's Northvolt have plans for large lithium-ion battery factories in Europe so far and some leading European carmakers have already struck deals with Asian suppliers setting up in Hungary and Poland.""We are considering cell production outside of China and that includes Europe,"" Julia Chen, Global Sales Director at BYD Batteries, told Reuters, speaking about the production of both automotive and home storage batteries.BYD (SZ:002594), which also makes electric buses, cars and solar panels, said it was not clear where in Europe a battery site might be. ""It would be possible wherever there's a market.""The company, which is backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), joins Korea's  SK Innovation  (KS:096770), Japan's GS Yuasa Corp (T:6674) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) <300750.SZ> in looking to locate battery plants in Europe.South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910), Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400) both have European factories due to open soon while China's GSR Capital already produces battery cells at a UK plant it bought from Nissan (T:7201).While Asian electric vehicle (EV) cell battery factories in Europe would bring jobs, Brussels is concerned companies in the bloc are missing out on a growth industry and risk becoming dependent on foreign technology.""We have to move fast because here we are in a global race. We need to prevent technological dependence on competitors,"" European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said at the launch of the European Battery Alliance's action plan in May.But some investors say they are wary of backing European EV battery suppliers after seeing local solar panel firms founder in the face of cheap Chinese imports over the past decade.European battery companies would need billions in EU support to rival Asian firms that have received similar state subsidies and Brussels may be better off promoting next-generation solid-state EV batteries instead, investors say.""I don't believe anyone in Europe can be competitive with the Asians,"" said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital, which advises firms in the energy, technology and power infrastructure sectors.For a graphic showing European EV battery supply and demand: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOX'GREEN' BATTERIESElectric and hybrid vehicles are expected to account for 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants CRU, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year.Global automakers plan to invest at least $90 billion in electric cars and batteries, the most expensive component in the vehicles, to finance hundreds of new models over the next five years.For now, carmakers in Europe have been importing batteries from Asia, but as production ramps up that will become less viable. Setting up production in Europe would cut shipping costs by a quarter, consultancy P3 Group.But some carmakers are not waiting for a European industry, instead signing contracts with Asian firms coming to the region.German's BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was not involved in the European alliance while Europe's biggest automaker, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said it plans to get batteries from LG Chem's Polish factory due to open this year. Mercedes maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) has awarded a contract to CATL.The European Commission's plan calls for 110 million euros in battery related research, help for projects from a 2.7 billion euro EU innovation fund and the development of an EU ""green battery"" trademark.Supporters of the initiative argue Europe can carve out a niche by selling green batteries produced with renewable energy and ethically sourced raw materials.FINANCING ROUNDNorthvolt, which has held talks with European automakers, aims to launch its $5 billion gigafactory in late 2020 and produce 32 gigawatt hours of battery capacity each year by 2023.But investors have been cautious about pouring money into new European battery ventures.Northvolt's first financing round, intended to raise 80 million euros to 100 million euros to help set up a test factory, took slightly longer than expected, a spokesman said.In the end, the bulk of the financing was provided by the Swedish Energy Agency and the European Investment Bank, which provided a loan of up to 52.5 million euros. Much of the profit from the battery value chain is generated by producers of raw materials, such as cobalt and lithium, and those who assemble cells into complex systems, experts say.""There's been a bit of imbalance in that value chain and that's one of the reasons you see a limited amount of players in Europe,"" said Northvolt founder and Chief Executive Peter Carlsson. ""But we think that the model that we're applying is changing this.""Carlsson, who used to work for U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla (O:TSLA), says Northvolt can make a profit through economies of scale, by using cheap hydropower and controlling the processing of raw materials.But Northvolt and TerraE will probably need about $2 billion each in government funding to build their gigafactories - given the state support provided for similar projects in Asia and the United States, said Asad Farid, an associate director at private bank Berenberg who specializes in battery technology.Four months after the European alliance launch the world's biggest automotive supplier, Germany's Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] abandoned plans to make battery cells, saying it was too risky.SOLID-STATE SOLUTION?Investors are wary because of their experience with solar panel manufacturers as well as rapid advances in technology that are slashing the price of battery packs, which consultants Arthur D puts at $190-250 per kilowatt hour now.""In battery manufacturing ... it's very much about scale. So the established producers in Korea, China and Japan have clear advantages over new entrants,"" said Simon Webber, lead portfolio manager on the global & international equities team at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) .Tim Crockford, who manages Hermes Investment Management's Impact Opportunities Fund, said he was more interested in European firms researching cathode technology, areas with major barriers to entry in terms of research and development.""The attraction of the industry decreases as you move further down the value chain. Things like battery manufacturers and the battery pack assemblers, it's much more fragmented market with lower barriers to entry,"" said Crockford.While Hermes has avoided companies mass-producing EV cell batteries it has taken stakes in a lithium producer and a company that makes materials for battery cathodes, he said.The lithium-ion batteries used now are also likely to be overtaken in a matter of years by so-called solid-state technology that is expected to produce even cheaper batteries with higher energy density.""The development cycle and the speed of technology progress in batteries is so huge at the moment, there's an opportunity for new and additional players to enter,"" said Timo Moeller, head of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility overview in Cologne.Developers in Europe believe that gives the region an opportunity to catch up.""Everybody is developing solid-state batteries so the gap (with Asia) will be narrower and narrower as we go along,"" said Diego Pavia, CEO of InnoEnergy, a sustainable energy company that has invested in Northvolt.

"By Abhinav RamnarayanLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday, as worries about a threatened U.S. military strike against Iran and a global trade conflict took the edge off a central bank-induced rally from earlier in the week.The New York Times said U.S. President Donald Trump approved military strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for the downing of an unmanned surveillance drone, then pulled back from launching the attacks. Iranian officials told Reuters on Friday that Tehran had received a message from U.S. President Donald Trump through Oman warning that a U.S. attack on Iran was imminent.Worries over possible military strikes persist, and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell from a seven-week high, driven mostly by weakness in Asian stocks. A rally by European stocks also faded, though a pan-European index was higher on the day. "" ... Market risk hasn't been switched off, it's merely gone dim,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets. ""However, it does appear equity markets are tired and may be suffering from a bit of a hangover after partying it up to post FOMC.""A Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting this week opened the door to rate cuts in the United States. Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15%. The index was still up nearly 4% on the week, during which it reached its highest level since May 8.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5%, Australian stocks declined 0.6% and Japan's Nikkei shed 0.8%.The promise of rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has kept sentiment strong in stock markets. Wall Street rose to record highs overnight, with the S&P 500 gaining nearly a percent. But tensions remain elevated, and safe-haven gold advanced to a six-year high of $1,410.78 an ounce on Friday, boosted by the geopolitical tensions and the prospect of a U.S. rate cut. At one stage, gold was up nearly 5% on the week. ""While lower real rates in the U.S. and globally make gold more attractive, the metal is being increasingly viewed as a cardinal asset to hedge against the scrim of unpredictability like the fear of recession and war,"" Innes said.Meanwhile, China and the United States are set to resume trade talks before Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet next week in Japan. Hopes of an agreement grew after the two leaders talked by telephone call, but neither side has signaled a shift from positions that led to an impasse last month.The Fed's signal that rate cuts were likely brought some relief, but also raised the specter of a global currency war. On Friday, the dollar fell against a basket of six major currencies to a two-week low of 96.495. The index has shed roughly 1% this week.The dollar has fallen 1.35% versus the yen this week, reaching a six-month low of 107.045 yen on Friday.In oil markets, U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.46% at $57.33 per barrel.

"Investing.com - A look at the top five things that rocked markets this past week.Earnings Season Kicked into Full Gear US stocks shrugged off a possible US government shutdown to close at record highs as ongoing optimism over earnings spurred investor appetite for risker assets.Financials got the week off to a good start amid quarterly earnings report from US Bancorp (NYSE:USB),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that beat Wall Street estimates, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bucked the trend, reporting its first quarterly loss since 2011.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) quarterly report Thursday also garnered attention after the tech company reported quarterly revenue growth for the first time in twenty-three quarters as its move into cloud, artificial intelligence and block chain technology offset declines from its traditional software business.The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.WTI Crude Oil Snapped 4-Week Winning Streak The weekly streak of gains in crude oil prices came to an abrupt end this week as investors weighed the impact of rising US production on OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies amid comments from the IEA.The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report, warned that rising non-OPEC production would offset a raft of positive factors supporting oil prices including ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.Crude oil futures settled at $61.44, down 58 cents.Pound, Sterling Downed the DollarIt was another miserable week for the dollar as it struggled to find its footing amid a surge in both the pound and sterling.EUR/USD notched its fifth-straight weekly win, rising above four-year highs despite European Central Bank (ECB) officials’ attempts to quash investor expectations that the central bank would announce plans to unwind its massive stimulus programme at next week’s meeting.GBP/USD rose to its highest since the June 2016 Brexit vote amid growing expectations that the Bank of England would soon have to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating.Gold Fought Off Pressure From Soaring US Government Bond Yields Gold prices held above four-month highs this week despite coming under pressure from a surge in government bond yields to multi-year highs.Yields on United States 10-Year this week rose to their highest since 2014 amid strong China economic growth data and rising expectations for faster inflation growth.Macquarie said that risks of a reversal in gold prices are rising, as it is “harder for gold to ignore the impressive snapback in real yields” since the turn of the year.Crypto-Market Crashed. Attempted Recovery. But Remains Under Pressure. A sea of red swept over crypto-markets this week after a crypto-crash Tuesday through Wednesday unfolded in markets, wiping billions of dollars from the market as investors fled positions amid fears that China and Korea were planning a ban on cryptocurrency-related activity.The total cryptocurrency market cap slumped to a low of about $478 billion at the depths of the crash on Wednesday before rebounding to about $562 billion Friday. That is markedly lower than the $829 billion total market cap peak set less than two weeks ago on Jan. 7.As the sell-off deepened, Ripple XRP fell to a low of $0.87 on the poloniex exchange, Ethereum fell to a low of $770, Bitcoin fell to a low $9,231. The ‘big 3’ cryptocurrencies by market cap, however, have since recovered some of their losses but remain under pressure.",1,2

"(Reuters) - Investment firm Third Point LLC and  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) squared off over plans for the company's future on Tuesday, with the hedge fund pushing for hiring a ""highly qualified"" chief executive officer and the company saying it was already searching for a permanent chief. Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, unveiled a 100-day plan that includes reviewing the company's recently concluded strategic review and reevaluating its planned divestitures, hiring a ""world-class permanent CEO"" and refreshing the company's core legacy products.The company said the hedge fund ""simply and effectively copied and pasted the actual plan outlined by Campbell"", adding that the plan was not thoroughly thought out.""Vote for us and we'll think of something,"" the company said about Third Point's plan.Loeb has nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell's controlling family, to replace all board members at the Nov. 29 annual meeting, in what will be the season's most contentious proxy battle.But he faces a high hurdle with other heirs controlling roughly 40 percent of the company.Loeb and his nominees are set to make their case to influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday that will issue a report in several weeks.Campbell has been hurt by falling soup sales and a higher debt burden in the wake of its Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis.The company said on Tuesday it was already searching for a permanent chief, with Third Point saying the proxy contest would make it difficult for Campbell to attract top talent. The hedge fund said Bill Toler, a member of its slate and CEO of Hostess Brands, would be prepared to step in as interim CEO if needed. Third Point last week sued Campbell in a New Jersey court alleging that the company misled investors with incorrect statement. A ruling could come as soon as Friday which could potentially allow the hedge fund's lawyers to question Campbell board members Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance. ",1,2
"By Joey RouletteCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched the first batch of 60 small satellites into low-Earth orbit on Thursday for Musk's new Starlink internet service.A Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellites blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at about 10:30 p.m. local time (0230 GMT Friday), clearing a key hurdle for a business venture that Musk hopes will generate much-needed cash for his larger ambitions in space.The launch came a week after two back-to-back countdowns for the mission were scrubbed - once due to high winds over the Cape and the next night in order to update satellite software and ""triple-check"" all systems.The 60 satellites flown into space were released into orbit as planned about an hour after Thursday's launch, and the Falcon 9's main-stage reusable booster rocket flew back to Earth for a successful landing on a barge floating in the Atlantic.SpaceX said it would probably take another day to learn whether all the satellites deployed were functioning properly. Each weighs about 500 pounds (227 kg), making them the heaviest payload carried aloft by SpaceX to date.They represent the initial phase of a planned constellation capable of beaming signals for high-speed internet service from space to paying customers around the globe.Musk has said he sees the new Starlink venture as an important new revenue stream for his California-based Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, whose launch service income he expects to top out at around $3 billion a year.He told reporters last week that makes Starlink pivotal in helping pay for his larger goals of developing a new spacecraft to fly paying customers to the moon and for eventually trying to colonize Mars.""We think this is a key stepping stone on the way toward establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the moon,"" said billionaire Musk, who is also chief executive officer of automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. At least 12 launches carrying similar payloads are needed to achieve constant internet coverage of most of the world, Musk said. For now, Starlink is only authorized for U.S. operations.Musk faces stiff competition. Airbus SE-backed OneWeb launched its own clutch of satellites in February, while LeoSat Enterprises and Canada's Telesat are also working to build data networks. In each network, the tiny satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites, a technological shift made possible by advances in laser technology and computer chips.Musk said SpaceX would begin approaching customers later this year or next year. As many as 2,000 satellites will be launched per year, with the ultimate objective of placing up to 12,000 into orbit. ",1,2
"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com --   BP   (LON:BP) chief executive Bob Dudley bowed out on the sweetest of high notes on Tuesday, raising the company’s dividend less than a week after arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut the rate at which it returns cash to shareholders.The company raised its quarterly payout to 10.5 cents a share, from 10.25c previously, after its preferred measure of underlying profit fell less than expected in the fourth quarter of the year. According to data compiled by Investing.com, that takes the yield on one of the U.K. FTSE 100’s most reliable dividends up to 7%. The  BP  (LON:BP) share price rose 4.5% in response, while the FTSE 100 rose only 1.2%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.0%.By contrast, Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut its buyback plans for this year by 60%, and while it left its dividend untouched, the accompanying rise in net debt put questions marks over its ability to stay so free with its cash. Shell, for its part, is now yielding 7.39%. BP  (LON:BP), at least, is bringing in more cash in these days than it used to. The acquisition of BHP’s shale assets in the U.S. kept the expected decline in upstream profit to less than one-third, and the headwinds from the Gulf of Mexico spill a decade ago continue to drop: this year, BP will pay less than $1 billion in costs related to that accident, down from $2.4 billion last year.But the sustainability of the new dividend is still likely to be tested. Production is likely to fall from last year’s average of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the current quarter due to the ongoing disposal program, while the company also expects lower refining margins and bigger discounts for its heavier north American crude blends. Most worrying, naturally, is the impact of the novel coronavirus on global oil demand. Chief financial officer Brian Gilvary told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the company sees the virus wiping out one-third of all forecast demand growth this year – a reality check to those still hoping for a V-shaped rebound in global demand and economic activity. Gilvary said the demand destruction is likely to be in the range of 300,000-500,000 barrels a day. Brent crude prices dropped below $55 a barrel for the first time since the end of 2018 on Tuesday, before recovering to trade at $54.86 a barrel by 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT).  BP  (LON:BP) has set itself the target of generating a return on average capital employed of over 10% at that price level by 2021, while keeping gearing below 30%.Given that  BP  (LON:BP) and other majors weren’t able to cover their capex and dividends at even $60 a barrel the last time oil prices collapsed in 2015/6, this represents some remarkable progress. But, as Tuesday’s presentation made clear, it depends on rapid sales of marginal assets. BP is targeting over $15 billion in disposal proceeds by the middle of next year. The company may be well on top of its core projects, but unless crude prices turn around, the risk is that it will have to sell some of its better assets to meet that target. ",1,2
"(Bloomberg) -- Slowing economic growth, shrinking central bank balance sheets and continued bouts of volatility will help make 2019 another poor year for risk-adjusted investment returns, with few obvious havens, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).“Expect better but still low returns in 2019” for multi-asset global allocation portfolios, Goldman strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissman wrote in a note Monday. While the decline in valuations across asset classes has improved the medium-term outlook, “we see a weaker expected macro backdrop in 2019 as likely to limit return potential,” they wrote.The gloomy outlook matches the experience of what’s been a rough year for financial markets. Investors have been rattled by everything from monetary policy normalization to tariff threats to global trade, a slowdown in China and the prospect that corporate-earnings growth has peaked. In what some have called a regime change, bonds have also been poor hedges for equities, upending the classic 60-40 portfolio strategy.For their part, the Goldman strategists still advise an overweight allocation to stocks, but recommend a bigger holding of cash than benchmarks suggest and have an underweight call on bonds. The team downgraded credit to underweight last week.“We still see poor risk-adjusted returns in fixed income: we forecast negative total returns for bonds with more upward pressure on yields and credit spreads” in the first half of next year, they wrote. “There may be less reason to be bearish” on bonds by the latter part of 2019, as 10-year Treasuries “could reprice in the event of a more severe growth slowdown or deeper equity drawdown,” they said.While far from catastrophic, this year is set to go down as one of the worst years for risk-adjusted cross-asset returns outside of crisis periods over the past quarter century, Goldman analysis indicates.Though questions are emerging about the “strategic case” for commodities, Goldman has an overweight call on the asset class, with “significant near-term upside to oil” after the big tumble in crude the past two months. The team favors gold, with the dollar expected to weaken next year.With the traditional bond hedge to equities unattractive, Goldman has also recommended that investors consider derivatives. With higher volatility, one tactic could involve selling calls on equities and buying puts after rallies, and buying calls and selling puts after “sharp corrections,” the strategists wrote separately last week.",0,0

"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis will see the world's biggest firms slash dividend payouts between 17%-23% this year or what could be as much as $400 billion, a new report has shown, although sectors such as tech are fighting the trend.Global dividend payments plunged $108 billion to $382 billion in the second quarter of the year, fund manager Janus Henderson has calculated, equating to a 22% year-on-year drop which will be the worst since at least 2009. All regions saw lower payouts except North America, where Canadian payments proved to be resilient. Worldwide, 27% of firms cut their dividends, while worst affected Europe saw more than half do so and two thirds of those cancel them outright.""2020 will see the worst outcome for global dividends since the global financial crisis,"" Janus Henderson said in a report published on Monday.""We now expect headline global dividends to fall 17% in a best-case scenario, paying $1.18 trillion... Our worst-case scenario could see payouts drop 23% to $1.10 trillion."" (Graphic: Global dividends total since 2009 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkzddevm/Pasted%20image%201598005728376.png) A break down of the various sectors showed some big differences too.Banks and other financial firm that have been ordered by the European Central Bank to stop paying dividends accounted for half of the 45% reduction in Europe's Q2 dividend drop to $77 billion.Miners and oil firms were hit badly by the broad slump in commodity prices and consumer discretionary companies saw their operations hard hit by government lockdowns too, resulting in much lower payments.In contrast, tech and telecoms and healthcare firms' dividends were relatively unaffected, with dividends up 1.8% and 0.1% respectively on an underlying basis. (Graphic: Banks, retailers and media dividends slammed but tech powering on - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwayedpw/Pasted%20image%201598005233292.png) That big tech resilience has also helped Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Apple (O:AAPL) power their way into the top ten of world dividend payers for the first time this year. That list is still topped by Nestle (S:NESN). ""Dividend trends are reflecting the trends in society and the stock market at the moment,"" said Janus Henderson's head of global equity income, Ben Lofthouse.""Probably we are going to see increases from parts of the tech sector,"" he added. ""There are a lot of very strong balance sheets in that area.""Going forward, he said, some key factors will determine how strong the recovery in dividends will be. The most obvious is the path of the coronavirus, but there is also what U.S. firms do later this year and whether Europe's banks get the green light early next year to restart their payments.""The big question for the U.S. is what will happen in the fourth quarter. If many companies make significant cuts to their dividends, payouts will be fixed at a lower level until towards the end of 2021.""

"By Sankalp Phartiyal, Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Aditya KalraMUMBAI/BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart's board is yet to finalize a deal to sell a controlling stake to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, adding a deal could just be days away.Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified sources, that Flipkart's board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion.A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart's board had ""in-principle"" approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved.The first two sources said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan's SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said.""SoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,"" one of the sources said.Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion.Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show.Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.AMAZON OFFEREarlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer.Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart's biggest rival in India.Amazon's move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers.Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said.Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country's antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters.A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested ""innovations or remedies.""""This definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,"" he added.Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm.Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester.Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.

"TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) workers began a brief strike on Wednesday over plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs in response to the coronavirus crisis, which has stripped demand for jets as airlines cope with a plunge in tourism and business travel.Unions said up to 8,000 workers were expected to join the action scheduled to last 1.5 hours in Toulouse, France, where employees were preparing to march alongside one of the runways at Toulouse-Blagnac airport overlooked by Airbus headquarters.The airport was due to remain open.""Airbus has a real responsibility to get to grips with its restructuring which is excessive and gives a terrible example to suppliers,"" said Jean-Francois Knepper, who represents the Force Ouvriere union.In Germany, the IG Metall union urged Airbus to avoid forced redundancies at the planemaker or its Premium AEROTEC unit.Unions have called a wider day of action in French plants on Thursday.Asked to comment on the protests, Airbus referred back to a statement last week by CEO Guillaume Faury that it was facing the ""gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced"" and was committed to limiting the social impact of its reorganisation.Airbus has said a third of the 15,000 jobs are set to go in France included 3,378 in the southwestern city of Toulouse where it assembles wide-body jets and some smaller A320s.Europe's largest aerospace group has historically enjoyed stable labour relations with its unions and strikes are rare. Workers staged a similar protest during a smaller restructuring exercise in 2008, when Airbus avoided compulsory layoffs.Facing the industry's worst crisis over the impact of worldwide lockdowns, Airbus has refused to rule out forced redundancies this time round but sketched out concessions in return for extensions in furlough schemes and research aid.

"By Jörn Poltz and Douglas BusvineMUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - German health group  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG) said on Sunday it was buying  Varian Medical  Systems Inc (N:VAR) of the United States for $16.4 billion in a deal that seeks to create the global leader in cancer care solutions.The deal is the first major growth move by Healthineers since it was spun off and floated in 2018 by Siemens (DE:SIEGn), which is undertaking a broader shakeup of its conglomerate structure to create room for its business units to do their own deals.Siemens, which will retain control over Healthineers, will provide bridge financing for the deal that will be partly refinanced by a rights issue by the medical technology unit later this year.Under the agreed transaction, Healthineers will acquire all shares in Varian for $177.50 each in cash, representing a 24% premium to the U.S. company's closing price on Friday and 42% above its 30-day weighted average.""With this takeover, we are significantly strengthening our position - in addition to cardiology and neurology - in the field of oncology,"" Chief Financial Officer Jochen Schmitz told Reuters in an interview.CEO Bernd Montag rejected suggestions that Healthineers had overpaid for Varian. ""This is an icon in our industry,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""If you put it into perspective we achieved a sensible price.""Through the deal to buy Varian, Healthineers acquires the leader in radiation therapy with a market share of over 50%.Healthineers highlighted a long-term rise in the incidence of cancer - from 14 million cases worldwide in 2010 to a forecast 25 million in 2030. That translates into an addressable market of $20 billion that is forecast to grow at an annual rate of between 6% and 10%, the company said in a presentation on the deal.The transaction, first reported by Bloomberg, is subject to approval by Varian shareholders and regulators. It is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and be accretive to Siemens Healthineers' adjusted basic earnings per share within 12 months of that.""With Siemens Healthineers, we will transform care for a greater number of patients worldwide, as well as broaden opportunities for our employees as part of a larger and more global organization,"" Varian President and Chief Executive Officer Dow Wilson said. BALANCE SHEET SUPPORTConglomerate Siemens is effectively putting its balance sheet to work to fund the deal, providing a bridging loan of 15.2 billion euros ($17.9 billion) to Healthineers.The medical technology unit aims to replace 50% of that through a rights issue this year, subject to market conditions.Siemens said in a statement that it expressly welcomed the deal and would raise the money for the bridging loan by issuing bonds. It will not participate in the rights issue, meaning its stake in Healthineers will be diluted to about 72% from 85%.Siemens aims to maintain its A+ debt ratings, which put it firmly in investment grade.Healthineers also pre-released fiscal third quarter results instead of on Monday due to the acquisition announcement. They showed its revenue declined 6.9% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 3.3 billion euros due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Its adjusted operating margin was 13.9%, down 1.2 percentage points from the same period a year earlier, while adjusted basic earnings per share fell 21% to 30 euro cents.The company said it expects revenue to be flat in fiscal 2020 while adjusted basic earnings per share are seen at between 1.54 and 1.62 euros, compared to 1.70 euros last year, assuming the business environment does not deteriorate further.

"By Sankalp PhartiyalNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google will collaborate with India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say.Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost ""4G or even 5G"" smartphone that Reliance would design.The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India.Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.""If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys.Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron (TW:3231) and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CONTENT IS KINGThe alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), which could bolster its smartphone ambitions. While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.

"Investing.com - A Trump Administration decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on goods imported from China set off a huge rally Tuesday that reclaimed most of Monday's losses.The Administration delayed the imposition of tariffs on some goods until Dec. 15, which should give retailers plenty of time to stock their shelves.""We're doing this for the Christmas season,"" President Donald Trump told reportersThe rally sent the S&P 500 up 1.48%, the Dow Jones industrials up 1.44% and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 2%.The gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq -- 42.57 points and 153 points, respectively -- recovered all of Monday's losses. The Dow, which gained about 373 points, ended the day about 7.5 points short of a total recovery from its 380-point loss on Monday.The Nasdaq 100 index, which has a concentration in big tech, jumped more than 2.2%. The index more than recovered its Monday loss, ending the day 82 points ahead of Friday's close.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), electronics retailer   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY),   Nike   (NYSE:NKE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) were among the biggest winners from the decision.Apple rose 4.2% and contributed nearly 58 points to the Dow by itself. It was also the sixth-best performer among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The tariff delays were concentrated on a wide variety of goods that are big sellers in the holiday shopping season, including cell phones, tennis racquets, video game consoles, computer keyboards, footware and clothing.The White House had vowed to impose the tariffs on Sept. 1, but the announcement in late July unnerved markets, unleashing wild swings in U.S. stock prices. Tariffs will be imposed Sept. 1, on a number of products, including food products.The Dow was up nearly 530 points before some traders sold to lock in profits. Twenty-seven of the 30 Dow stocks were higher. Two of the decliners -- Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) -- were off very slightly.Worries that China was about to send troops into Hong Kong to quell local protests appeared to have a modest effect on the markets, but analysts said markets would react unfavorably to such news.Crude oil prices were higher as the rally took off. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $2.17 to $57.10 a barrel. Brent crude rose $2.73 to $61.30 a barrel.Gold, however, fell back, with the December futures contract settling at $1,512.30 an ounce, off $5.But there remained worries about global growth as the trade fight between Washington and Beijing grinds on. Investors could see it in the narrowing spread between 2-year Treasury securities and the 10-year note. Many analysts believe a 10-year that's less than a 2-year yield (inversion) is a strong signal that a recession is coming.The 10-Year Treasury yield closed at 1.702%, after falling to as low as 1.618%. The 2-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.673%, bring the spread to just 2.9 basis points, or 2.9 one-hundredths of a percentage point. Technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, communications services shares (which include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), were among the strongest sectors. Realvestate and utility stocks were basically flat.Department store giant Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Briggs & Stratton (NYSE:BGG) are among companies reporting quarterly results on Wednesday.Winners and Losers in the S&P 500Cyber-security company Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) were among the top S&P 500 performers on Tuesday.Utility giant Southern Company (NYSE:SO), oil-and-gas producer Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), oil-services company Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP) and apartment developer United Dominion Realty Trust (NYSE:UDR) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers.",1,1
"By Luis Valentin OrtizSAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Puerto Rico's federal oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline on the bankrupt island's government through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in law.Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico's legislature filed lawsuits in July claiming the board, which was created by the U.S. Congress under the so-called PROMESA Act in 2016, overstepped its power by imposing a belt-tightening fiscal plan and budget on the government that require public policy actions.The board, which sought to dismiss the litigation, argued that if it cannot impose reforms through a fiscal plan over the objections of the governor, ""then PROMESA created a toothless oversight board.""Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the PROMESA Act gives the board the power to make ""binding policy choices"" for the U.S. commonwealth despite the governor's objection. However, when it comes to policy measures dependent on the adoption of new laws or the modification or repeal of existing laws, the board ""has only budgetary tools and negotiations to use to elicit any necessary buy-in from the elected officials and legislators,"" the ruling stated.While the ruling empowered the board in fiscal matters, it also noted that only the Puerto Rico government can pass laws necessary to implement new fiscal policies.Swain noted that the PROMESA Act is ""an awkward power-sharing arrangement"" because Puerto Rico officials have the ability ""to obstruct implementation altogether or complicate it in such a way as to cripple Puerto Rico's ability to use it to promote the needed return to fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets.""With Puerto Rico sinking under roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, the board in May 2017 sought a form of bankruptcy restructuring in U.S. court.Rossello blasted the ruling for giving ""total budgetary authority to the unelected members of the oversight board, which supersede that of the elected officials of the Government of Puerto Rico and its legislature."" ""While we analyze the possibility of appealing the court's decision, we will keep looking for ways to work with the oversight board so that we avoid harsh, draconian measures that would be detrimental to our people,” he said in a statement.The oversight board said the ruling upholds its authority and urged the Puerto Rico government to fully implement the fiscal plans and budgets it certified.""There can be no doubt that the fiscal year 2019 budget certified by the oversight board is the only one and must be enforced,"" said Board Chairman José Carrión in a statement.""We call on all stakeholders to get back to work in the interests of Puerto Rico, in order to end decades of mismanagement and rebuild our island.”While the judge dismissed several counts in the governor's lawsuit largely on technical grounds, she kept other parts alive, rejecting the board's argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Swain dismissed the legislators' lawsuit in its entirety. ",1,2

"KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) ""cheated"" the country in dealings with state fund 1MDB and that U.S. authorities have promised to help return the fees the Wall Street bank earned from the fund.The U.S. investment bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise funds through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), which is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.Goldman's stock fell to a near two-year low on Monday after Malaysia's Minister of Finance Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a ""full refund"" of the around $600 million in fees the bank earned from raising $6.5 billion for the fund. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs on Monday said in an email to Reuters that the bank denied any wrongdoing. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, including some money that Goldman Sachs helped raise, by high-level officials of the fund and their associates from 2009 through 2014.U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers earlier this month. One of them, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.""There is evidence that Goldman Sachs has done things that are wrong,"" Mahathir said in an interview with U.S. news channel CNBC aired on Tuesday.""Obviously we have been cheated through the compliance by Goldman Sachs people,"" he said, without specifying details.The bank's compliance controls ""don't work very well"", he added.A second Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on Mahathir's comments in the interview.Asked by reporters later in Singapore if he had officially requested the DOJ to help return money that Goldman earned from 1MDB, Mahathir said:""It takes a little bit of time but they (DOJ) have promised that they will give back the money."" He was speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Singapore.The DOJ was not immediately available for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. Anwar Ibrahim, appointed successor to 93-year-old Mahathir, told parliament on Tuesday that the country needs to take ""more aggressive measures"" to reclaim the fees and losses ""due to the effects on Malaysia's image"".Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Finance Minister Lim repeated his stance that Malaysia wants to reclaim fees paid to Goldman Sachs, and added that the country will also seek consequential losses.""The Malaysian government will want to reclaim all the fees paid, as well as all the losses including the interest rate differential,"" Lim told reporters. He said the rate Malaysia paid was about 100 basis points higher than the market rate.Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly for planned investment.Lim did not say how Malaysia would seek to recoup any money beyond that he will leave the matter to Malaysia's attorney general.Citing sources, Reuters reported in June that Malaysia was considering asking the U.S. Justice Department to get Goldman Sachs to return the fees it had earned from the 1MDB deals.Malaysia's government, elected to power only in May, is scrambling to bring back funds that were allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB - a fund founded by former premier Najib Razak.The 1MDB scandal was a major reason for Najib's shock election loss. Najib has since been charged with corruption as part of Malaysia's investigation into 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, described by U.S. and Malaysian authorities as central to the 1MDB scandal, was charged by U.S. prosecutors this month.

"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) overall vehicle registrations nearly halved in the U.S. state of California during the fourth quarter, according to a Dominion Cross-Sell report, which collates data from state motor vehicle records.The massive drop comes as tax credit for Tesla buyers ended in 2019. It had fallen to $3,750 at the start of the year and had halved to $1,875 in July.An existing $7,500 U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which allows taxpayers to deduct a part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales, which Tesla hit in July 2018.The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plummeted 46.5% to 13,584 in the quarter ended December 2019, from 25,402 in the same period a year earlier.Model 3 registrations, which accounted for about three-fourth of the total, halved to 10,694.Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.""One can assume that Tesla has hit peak performance in the U.S. because they have not exceeded their 2018 results for five months now,"" said Shane Marcum, vice-president of Cross-Sell.The new data comes nearly two weeks after Tesla beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after a few turbulent years.",0,0
"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows but remained under pressure Thursday, paced by selling in tech stocks as investors continued to assess the Covid-19 virus outbreak.The S&P 500 slipped 0.72%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.69%.It wasn’t immediately clear what triggered the sudden move lower in stocks. But reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing dampened hopes that China’s capital would be able to resume normal operations sooner rather than later.A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, Chinese state-run Global Times reported.Beijing recently ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on movements and a ban on public gatherings that forced schools to shut down.Tech led the broader decline lower amid worries about prolonged disruptions to supply chains in China at a time when several companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), have cautioned on outlook as the virus outbreak continues.A slew of mixed earnings from corporates before the open, meanwhile, did little to help sentiment on stocks.Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) slumped 18% after the theme park operator delivered a softer outlook on profit and cut its dividend by nearly 70% amid a surprise loss in the fourth quarter.ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) plunged 17% to a 52-week low after its earnings missed estimates and guidance was weak.Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) bucked the trend, rising 19%, after its fourth-quarter losses were not as bad as Wall Street had estimates amid a ramp-up in activity on its housing platform.In deal news,   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) bought discount broker E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) for $13 billion, sending shares of latter up 24%.Some on Wall Street, however, were critical of the shares-only deal, which will dilute the bank’s stock, with   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) calling it “value destroying.” Wells Fargo downgraded Morgan Stanley to equal-weight from overweight and cut its price target on the stock to $58 from $65.",0,0

"MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian government panel has suggested creating an asset management company (AMC) to resolve bad loans above 5 billion rupees ($73 million), among steps to clean up the banking sector, the interim finance minister said on Monday.The panel of bankers was formed last month as lenders, already burdened by a near-record 9.5 trillion rupees of soured loans as of last year, reported a further rise in bad loans in the quarter to March after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules.""This is a completely bank-led resolution process and there is no immediate role for the government in this,"" minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in a late-night news conference, adding that banks can transfer bad assets to the AMC or an alternate investment fund depending on market conditions.Goyal, who is standing in for regular Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, also said that for small and medium sized industries with loans of up to 500 million rupees, a template will be made so that bank officials can decide within 90 days of a loan going sour how to resolve them.India's 21 state banks majority-owned by the government account for two-thirds of banking assets in the country and hold close to 90 percent of soured loans. The top banks include  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) and  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK).The bad loans problem, driven largely by infrastructure sectors including power, has stifled banks' ability to lend to new businesses to boost growth critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election by May.In an interview published on Monday, Modi said that he identified the problem of bad loans soon after taking office in 2014 and has been working to resolve it.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's embattled industrial group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) expects job cuts as part of an overhaul of its operations, daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing an interview with the top executive.""Our employees... are fully aware that this (overhaul) cannot be accomplished without cutbacks,"" interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff said in an interview with the newspaper to be published on Friday.""People know that we have to earn money. At corporate headquarters, we already saved more than 100 million euros ($115.55 million) in costs in the first nine months of our fiscal year, and without causing any noise. Getting by without any job cuts at all will certainly not be possible,"" Kerkhoff was quoted as saying.Essen-based Thyssenkrupp, which has been in crisis-mode since CEO Heinrich Hiesinger and Supervisory Board Chairman Ulrich Lehner both resigned last month, set itself new mid-term profit margin targets for its four divisions earlier on Thursday. Activist shareholders Cevian and Elliott, which together hold about a fifth of Thyssenkrupp, have led calls for a major improvement in the company's operating performance.Separately, Kerkhoff told the newspaper he does not feel pressed for time as he leads the search for a new chairman and strategy for the group.

"By Hideyuki SanoTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit a record high on Thursday though concerns about the Trump administration's protectionist stance tempered enthusiasm in financial markets, while the dollar struggled after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed a weaker currency.European shares are expected to tick up slightly, with spread-betters seeing a small rise of 0.1 percent in Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's Cac. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3 percent to an all-time peak for the ninth session in a row.Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1 percent, hit by the dollar's decline against the yen.MSCI ACWI, the index provider's broadest gauge of the world's stock markets, boosted its gains for the month to 6.6 percent. It had registered declines only on two days this year amid optimism over an extended growth spurt in the global economy and solid earnings.A Reuters poll of over 500 economists showed the global economy is expected to grow at the fastest pace since 2010.The upbeat mood, however, has come up against renewed fears of protectionism after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels earlier in the week.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, hinted at action against China, saying U.S. trade authorities were investigating whether there is a case for taking action over China's infringements of intellectual property.Trump is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday.Also in the Swiss Alpine town, Mnuchin made a major departure from traditional U.S. currency policy on Wednesday, saying ""obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" Analysts say they cannot remember any U.S. Treasury Secretary openly embracing a cheaper dollar at least in the last two decades or so.""I was speculating the Trump administration may role out something with fanfare given its big delegation to Davos,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.""I'd think the real aim of Mnuchin's comments on the dollar is not so much engineering a weaker dollar per se as putting pressure on trading partners to do some trade deals with the administration,"" he added. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to a three-year low of 88.816, falling 1.9 percent so far this week.The euro rose to as high as $1.2459, a peak not scaled since December 2014, ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day.The meeting comes against a backdrop of heightened speculation over when it will end its vast stimulus and signal a rise in interest rates from record lows.The dollar slipped to 108.74 yen, its lowest levels since mid-September.The Chinese yuan also strengthened, gaining 0.5 percent to 6.3280 yuan per dollar in onshore trade, hitting its highest level since November 2015.It rose 2.7 percent so far this month. The gains, if sustained, would mark the biggest monthly rise ever. Gold jumped past its September peak to 1-1/2-year high of $1,365.8 per ounce. A break above its July 2016 high around $1,375 would take it to a four-year high.Brazilian markets might be in for another strong day following rally in the real and shares on Wednesday after an appeals court upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a major blow to the popular politician's plans to run again for the presidency this year.He was perceived to be not friendly to markets, even though his eight-year reign from 2003 saw strong gains in Brazilian shares and currency.Oil prices rallied to three-year high, boosted by a record 10th straight weekly decline in U.S. crude inventories, though reduced refining activity and rising production signaled U.S. stocks could rise in coming weeks.International benchmark Brent futures were nudging $71 per barrel - $71.03 a barrel at 0232 GMT - a level not seen since early December 2014 and up 45 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close.Bitcoin extended its rebound from Tuesday's low of $9,927 to $11,541, up 1 percent so far in Asia.

Chinese backsliding on the deal would give Trump the pretext to raise import tariffs on its goods again. That said, the latest U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index pointed to improvement in May from April, even though the reading was grim. The market is also still supported by trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus and the reopening of states as the coronavirus outbreak passes its peak.In corporate news, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will be in focus after a number of employees walked out Monday in protest against the tech giant's decision not to remove or flag a controversial post by Trump last week.

"By Shu Zhang and Bobby YipSANYA, China (Reuters) - China's Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656) on Saturday launched its Atlantis Sanya luxury resort in a $1.74 billion bet that the sail-shaped development will become an icon in Hainan - China's Hawaii - and a beacon to both domestic and foreign tourists. The conglomerate's 11 billion yuan ($1.74 billion) investment in China's southernmost province is in line with the central government's desire to further boost tourism in Hainan, already popular among Chinese holidaymakers.Fosun, co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, has been one of the country's most acquisitive overseas dealmakers.But like peers including Dalian Wanda Group and HNA Group, Fosun - China's largest privately held conglomerate - has faced increased scrutiny by Beijing for debt-fuelled, big-ticket foreign deals and is now pursuing a development path more closely aligned with Beijing's priorities.Tourism is viewed as key to China's shift towards a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one. Beijing aims to raise the country's tourism market revenue to 7 trillion yuan by 2020, from 5.3 trillion yuan last year.Hainan, one of China's top holiday destinations, has sought to internationalise its tourism sector since 2010 after winning approval from the central government to develop international tourism. But only 1.1 million out of 67 million visitors came from abroad in 2017.Located on Haitang Bay, one of the major bays in Sanya and known for its 22-kilometre strip of white, sandy beaches, Atlantis Sanya was inspired by Dubai's Atlantis, The Palm. The integrated resort offers hotel suites with views of underwater marine life, as well as a water park and a shopping mall.The resort, owned by Fosun and managed by Kerzner International [KZL.UL], occupies an area of 540,000 square metres - equal to 66 soccer pitches - and has 1,314 guest rooms. ""Atlantis Sanya is not only a forerunner of the supply-side reform of the tourism industry, but is also becoming a new landmark of Hainan tourism,"" Xu Zhenling, vice mayor of Sanya said at a news conference on Saturday ahead of the resort's grand opening scheduled for the evening.She said the resort will also raise Hainan's profile overseas, as the island province - China's largest economic development zone - seeks to further open up its economy and focus on developing modern tourism, services and high-technology industries.Plans to build China's first Atlantis resort in Hainan, the third in the world, were first unveiled in 2013.The resort adds to a broad portfolio owned by Fosun Tourism and Culture Group, a key profit growth driver for the conglomerate, which also owns the French Club Med holiday company and a stake in Canadian theatrical production company Cirque du Soleil.($1 = 6.3325 Chinese yuan renminbi) ",1,1

"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of AFC Ajax NV (AS:AJAX) rose the most in two years after the Dutch soccer club’s stunning UEFA Champions League victory over Real Madrid in the Spanish capital.Madrid, winners of European soccer’s elite competition for the last three seasons, were firm favorites with bookmakers to progress to the quarter finals after winning the first leg in Amsterdam 2-1 on Feb. 13. But two Ajax goals within the first 18 minutes on Tuesday night left Los Blancos, the world’s richest soccer club, chasing the tie.Dusan Tadic’s goal in the sixty-second minute meant the game’s richest team was all but out of the tournament, and the match finished 4-1 to Ajax, or 5-3 on aggregate. Ajax have won the tournament previously known as the European Cup four times, but the last victory was in 1995. The club hasn’t reached the quarter final since 2003.Ajax’s shares jumped 9.5 percent to 16.80 euros at 9:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 307.1 million euros ($347.2 million). The intraday advance of 11 percent was the biggest since March 2017.A place in the next round is worth an extra 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) in prize money, with another 31 million euros potentially at stake if clubs progress further.

Trump floated a plan to fine ZTE and shake up its management after his administration considering rolling back more severe penalties imposed for violating U.S. sanctions by shipping goods to Iran.Trump also said there was a ""substantial chance"" his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12.The president's comments come after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the two countries had put the prospect of a trade war ""on hold"" and agreed to hold more talks to boost U.S. exports to China.""As day worn on, Trump's comments about North Korea and not having a deal with ZTE just brought people back from yesterday's euphoria into more of a reality that this issue with trade is not going to end as quickly as many had thought,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.""So you're seeing a little bit of giveback,"" he said.The industrial sector (SPLRCI) dipped 1.3 percent, a day after posting its best percentage gain in nearly two months on the trade truce, while the energy index (SPNY) also fell 1.3 percent.Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares fell 3.3 percent, sending the stock to its lowest close since early April, a day after Consumer Reports said the company's new Model 3 car, despite many positives, had ""big flaws,"" highlighting issues with braking. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk late on Monday tweeted that the braking flaw can be fixed with a software update, and Consumer Reports said it would retest the brakes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 178.88 points, or 0.72 percent, at 24,834.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 8.57 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,724.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 15.58 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,378.46.Shares of Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) climbed 6.4 percent after the memory-chip maker announced a $10 billion stock-buyback plan.The financials sector (SPSY) rose 0.6 percent on hopes that a bill aimed at easing bank rules, put in place after the financial crisis, could be passed as soon as this week.The consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) fell 0.5 percent after warnings from retailer Kohl's and auto parts seller Autozone.Kohl's (N:KSS) tumbled 7.4 percent, weighing on other retailers, after forecasting slower growth in the second half of the year.Autozone (N:AZO) sank 9.5 percent after warning that higher costs would persist due to wage pressure.Steel stocks climbed after the United States said it would slap steep import duties on steel products with origins in China but shipped from Vietnam to evade anti-dumping orders.Carmakers Ford (N:F), General Motors (N:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (N:FCAU) gained slightly after Beijing announced tariff cuts on car imports.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 146 new highs and 36 new lows.

"(Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc's Chief Financial Officer Nancy Walsh is leaving after a year in the job at the struggling home furnishing retailer, which reported a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter on Wednesday.The company known for its wicker chairs and scented candles has been battling falling sales in the face of increasing competition from rivals such as Williams-Sonoma and online giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Walsh is the second top executive to leave the company in the last five months. Chief Executive Officer Alasdair James stepped down in December after his turnaround efforts failed to deliver results. The company had then said it was evaluating strategic options, but may not result in a sale.The company named director of consulting firm AlixPartners Deborah Rieger-Paganis as interim CFO and said it was considering closing up to 45 locations in fiscal 2020 due to lease expirations. It has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada. Pier 1 said the number of stores likely to be closed could increase by up to 15 percent if Pier 1 fails to achieve performance goals, sales targets, and reductions in occupancy and costs.Last month, Reuters reported the company has tapped debt restructuring lawyers to navigate potential negotiations with lenders.Pier 1, which has a market capitalization of about $55 million, had a long-term debt of $245.6 million as of March 2.The company on Wednesday also unveiled a plan to cut costs and save as much as $110 million in fiscal 2020 ""by resetting its gross margin and cost structure."" In the crucial holiday quarter, Pier 1 reported a 13.7 percent decline in same-store sales and missed Wall Street expectation for quarterly revenue as fewer customers visited its stores.""Our fourth-quarter sales and profitability were disappointing and reflect the execution issues we identified earlier in the year and have been working with urgency to correct,"" Cheryl Bachelder interim CEO said in a statement.Shares of the company were down 7 percent at 60 cents in extended trading.

"By Alistair SmoutLONDON (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned on Thursday any further escalation of trade tensions would damage aerospace firms globally, including the European planemaker's U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).The United States and the EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs on planes, tractors and food in the nearly 15-year trans-Atlantic dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.""The trade tensions that we see, we believe they are lose-lose tensions,"" Faury told reporters on a visit to London. Boeing on Wednesday urged the U.S. government, which has the first crack at imposing any tariffs since its WTO process is running several months ahead of the EU's, to restrict reprisals to European aircraft to avoid harming American manufacturers. But Faury said it would be impossible to isolate the fallout from the deteriorating international trade climate, which has also led to a tariff war between the United States and China.""These tensions, and the trade situation, are not supportive to any of the players in aerospace,"" he said.""We don't think we'll be losing more than the other guys in that situation, but we think it should be resolved in one way or another that enables global businesses like aviation to continue to grow,"" Faury said.The new Airbus CEO, who stepped up from its planemaking division a month ago, repeated warnings over the impact of Britain's European Union exit, while using softer language than his predecessor Tom Enders who threatened to quit the UK.Airbus, which makes wings in Britain and employs 14,000 people across the country, is using the delay in Brexit to ""prepare for all scenarios,"" Faury said, adding that a no-deal Brexit remained on the table, even if less likely.""Things have basically not changed, and therefore they are worsening. This long-lasting lack of clarity is ... a distraction,"" he said.""The UK is really a place where we are part of the ecosystem. Our plants and our sites in the UK are very competitive. We would like this to continue, whatever happens.""  ",1,2
"Investing.com - Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the world’s largest hedge fund warned Monday that a “big shakeout” in global markets is coming as investors adjust to a faster pace of interest rate increases.In an interview published in the Financial Times, Prince, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater warned that markets are entering a new era of volatility and said last week’s market turbulence was set to continue.“There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don’t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days,” he said. “We’ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.”A rout in financial markets last week saw $4tn wiped off the value of global shares and the U.S. market entered into a correction after falling more than 10% from January’s record highs.Wall Street staged a late rally on Friday but U.S. markets still recorded their worst week in two years as fears of faster inflation and thus more aggressive interest rate increases sparked a wave of selling.“Last year equity markets had a free run. But this year we are going from central banks contemplating tightening policy to actually doing it,” Prince said. “We will have more volatility as we are entering a new macroeconomic environment.”Prince also said that he expects global growth to remain on track despite the shift in central bank policy and heightened volatility in markets.“The real economy will outperform financial economy this year, the opposite of what we've seen in recent years,” he said.",0,0

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) pilots who are members of its Irish trade union will go on strike for the first time on July 12 after the union said on Tuesday the airline had failed to meet demands over new working practices.Europe's biggest budget carrier averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by deciding to recognize trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries.Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, has so far signed agreements with pilots in Italy and Britain, two of its largest markets, but also experienced minor disruption in Germany and Portugal.Ryanair pilots eligible to vote in a ballot called by the Forsa/IALPA trade union, which does not include contractors, backed the call to engage in industrial action and will strike for 24 hours next week.The union, which said 94 of the 95 ballots returned were in favor of industrial action, has advised Ryanair that it will notify it of additional strike days in due course but also remains available and willing to engage on the issues.A spokesman for Ryanair was not immediately available for comment.While Ryanair has also had success in Britain and Italy signing recognition agreements with cabin crew, some of its crew will gather in Dublin on Wednesday to demand better conditions in their first pan-European summit.At the same time, it faces the threat of strike action in Germany where pilots have until the end of July to vote on whether to stage further walkouts. Their union will continue negotiations in the mealtime, it said on Monday.Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned investors in May that he could not rule out the possibility of strikes and would face any action down.Share in the airline, which are down 21 percent from an all-time high last August before it had to cancel 20,000 flights over a rostering fiasco, triggering the pilot unrest, were 0.3 percent higher at 15.54 euros by 1450 GMT.

"Investing.com - Beyond Meat surged on Friday after delivering a narrower loss and guidance that prompted bullish calls from analysts.The vegan upstart brought in the buyers as it forecast that sales would top $210 million this year, a more than 100% increase from the $88 million seen last year. That was also above analysts' estimates for about $205 million.Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 35%.The rosier outlook was accompanied by sizzling first-quarter results, drawing a bullish call from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Bank of America raised its price target on the stock to $101 from $85.

"By John Benny and Liz Hampton(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) scraped past first-quarter profit estimates on Friday as higher costs weighed on a strong performance in its North America business.The oil industry has benefited from a 7.5 percent rise in U.S crude oil prices (CLc1) in the first quarter as a strengthening global economy and OPEC-led supply cut reduced excess global supplies.Shares of Schlumberger, considered a bellwether for the oilfield services and drilling industries, were down 1.3 percent at $69.40 in premarket trading as part of a broader decline in oil stocks and prices.Brent and U.S. crude turned negative after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized OPEC for rising prices that he said were being artificially increased and would not be accepted.Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services provider, said revenue from North America jumped nearly 52 percent to $2.84 billion.However, the company's total cost of manufacturing products and delivering services rose nearly 12 percent to $6.80 billion.Revenue from international operations, the company's biggest segment, fell 0.8 percent to $4.88 billion.Total revenue rose to $7.83 billion from $6.89 billion.Net profit attributable to Schlumberger rose to $525 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $279 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"(Reuters) - No more parties and events in homes listed on Airbnb, the short-term home rental company said on Thursday as it tries to enforce strict social-distancing norms to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.The new rules include a cap on occupancy at 16, with hosts or guests who try to skirt the rules facing a ban from Airbnb's community and even legal action, the company said on Thursday. ""Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,"" Airbnb said in a statement, adding that the ban applies to all future bookings.Airbnb said 73% of its listings globally already ban parties in their house rules, while some hosts allow small parties such as baby showers or birthday parties.Last year, Airbnb began imposing much stricter limits, starting with a global ban on ""party houses"" or listings that create persistent neighborhood nuisance.Airbnb has also updated its policies in light of the pandemic, removing both the ""event friendly"" search filter and ""parties and events allowed"" house rules.The global ban comes a day after Airbnb said it filed confidentially for an initial public offering with U.S. regulators, setting the stage for one of 2020's marquee stock market debuts.The potential IPO underscores a rebound in parts of the travel industry, which was battered this year by restrictions and shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.San Francisco-based Airbnb said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3, in part as U.S. travelers shy away from hotels and prefer to drive to local vacation rentals.

"By Philip BlenkinsopBRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Lionel Platteuw started planning how he would cope under Belgium's coronavirus lockdown, there was one item he wanted to make sure he had enough of - alcohol.""My first concern was that we didn't have enough beer and wine,"" said the Brussels-based consultant. ""I wasn't concerned about toilet paper, but I didn't want to be stuck at home without alcohol supplies.""Soaring sales of beer, wine and spirits at retail outlets suggest drinkers across the world took a similar attitude. Sales at British liquor stores leapt a third in March, while those for alcohol at U.S. retailers shot up more than 50% in the week after the country entered a state of national emergency.But the drinks industry isn't popping any corks.The surge in demand came as sales through bars, clubs and restaurants fell to zero as they were closed to contain the virus. And even as countries start to ease restrictions, these venues are likely to be at the back of the line to reopen. Manufacturers have also faced supply disruptions and, in some countries, even a ban on sales as authorities worry excessive drinking could jeopardise social distancing efforts. A deep global economic downturn also looks set to hit consumer spending, with signs drinkers are switching from premium brands to cheaper alternatives and multipacks.NO SOCIAL OCCASIONSIn the United States, ""on-trade"" drinking at bars and restaurants accounts for about 20% of spirits sales and 25% for beer, so off-premise drinking would need to keep growing by 25-30% to compensate.The signs are it's already starting to slow.While U.S. stores' alcohol sales are up a quarter since early March, the rate of growth slowed to 16% in the week to April 18, according to market research firm Nielsen. In Europe, bars generally account for a bigger proportion of alcohol sales, rising to 60% in Spain. In many developing countries, including China and Brazil and for beer in Nigeria and Ethiopia, at least half of drinking is in bars.Cees 't Hart, the chief executive of Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb), told Reuters that in Europe retail sales had already returned to normal after initial panic buying.Dutch rival  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) noted that even store-bought alcohol was often designed for group events now barred in most countries. ""Beer belongs to social occasions and these occasions for consumption are simply lost,"" Chief Executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said last month, after reporting beer volumes fell by a third in Italy and a quarter in Spain in March.SUPPLY PROBLEMS Lockdowns have created other problems for drinks makers. They have had to suspend production in countries such as China, India, Malaysia and Mexico, where there was only about 10 days of beer inventory last week.Draconian travel restrictions have also closed duty-free shops, a particular concern for spirits makers. Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the maker of Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey, has forecast an 80% decline of its ""travel retail"" business from February to June. In India, the world's largest whisky market, most alcohol shops were forced to shut in its countrywide lockdown. South Africa has banned all alcohol sales for more than a month.As restrictions start to ease, it is not clear how quickly drinkers will return to old habits. Manit Parikh, the head of an English learning technology company in Bengaluru, said he was ""gutted"" at not being able to have a drink or two in the lockdown, but also scared to go to liquor stores when they reopened with long lines on Monday.New York-based insurance industry temp Samantha Gool said she switched to more vodka from beer and her drinking increased when confined at home, although may have started to taper.Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research at Euromonitor International, believes there won't be a surge in demand as lockdowns gradually ease, with some bars going bust, social distancing limiting business and some customers wary of going out.BOXED WINE AND MULTIPACKSHe also believes the crisis could spell the end, or at least the suspension, of an industry-wide trend of the past two decades - persuading drinkers to spend more on ""premium"" brands.In the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, consumers traded down to cheaper products. And all the signs suggest the hit to jobs and economies from the coronavirus pandemic - at least in the short term - will be much bigger. Wine consumption in Europe is forecast to fall by 8% this year, with a particular hit for sparkling and vintage wines, according to the European Commission.In beer, marketing agency InMarket says AB InBev's (BR:ABI) budget Busch Light has seen the sharpest increase in sales since early March.In Europe, Carlsberg has seen consumers veer towards multi-packs, while Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize said its biggest increase in alcohol sales was boxed wine. Many smaller players, particularly once booming craft brewers, are suffering.Last year, the number of breweries in Europe passed 10,000. Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, secretary-general of the Brewers of Europe, sees the European market dropping by a third.""Some players have no channels to retail at all,"" he said. ""There will be people who will simply not survive."" ",0,0
"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Steelworkers union (USW) on Friday rejected a proposal by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc for an automatic extension of the national refinery workers' contract beyond its Feb. 1 expiration date, sources familiar with the talks said.The union also instructed local union negotiators to reject similar proposals being made at talks taking place around the United States, the sources said.The USW and Shell began negotiations on Wednesday for a new national agreement governing pay, health insurance, job security, and safety for 30,000 workers at U.S. refineries and chemical plants.A Shell spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Friday night.Royal Dutch Shell's U.S. arm, Shell Oil Co, represents the U.S. oil industry. Shell has been the lead company in oil worker contract negotiations since 1997. The proposal for an automatic extension of the contract could undermine the union's National Oil Bargaining Program, which tries to keep the national agreement and as many local contracts on the same expiration date, the sources said.These are the first negotiations for a national contract since 2015 when a stalemate led to rolling strikes that sent more than 7,000 workers off their jobs at 12 U.S. refineries and three chemical plants. The 2015 strike lasted about two months at most plants, but continued for months at some locations. The USW is seeking a three-year agreement with the oil industry that would replace the pact that expires on Feb. 1. The union's proposals include an 8 percent annual wage increase for each year of the contract. Union members with four years' experience earn about $40 an hour. ",0,0
"By Nick CareyDETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted a hefty drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for September, caused in part by a decline in sales in areas hit by Hurricane Florence and a tough comparison to the previous September when consumers rushed to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey. Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) bucked the trend for the month, reporting a 15 percent jump in U.S. sales, led by increases in sales of its lucrative Jeeps - especially its Cherokee and Compass models - and Ram pickup trucks.The solid performance put FCA's total sales ahead of longtime No. 2 U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) for the month of September.Hurricane Florence flooded large parts of North Carolina and South Carolina last month, leaving residents to deal with the deluge instead of shopping for new cars.Sales in September 2017 were boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which had flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August that year.The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales (SAAR) for September hit 18.1 million units in September 2017 - the highest sales pace since 2005.Despite the sales decline versus the same month in 2017, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the SAAR of U.S. car and light truck sales for September came in at 17.44 million vehicles - the highest sales pace since November 2017. This was above the SAAR of 16.9 million units expected by analysts.After a strong first half of the year, U.S. new auto sales are expected to dip in the second half of 2018, as rising interest rates in particular translate into higher monthly car payments and push more Americans toward buying used vehicles.U.S. consumers last month continued a longstanding trend of abandoning passenger cars for larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs.""September was a bloodbath for cars,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs told reporters on a conference call. ""They dropped like a rock.""Ford Motor Co (N:F) on Tuesday reported an 11.2 percent drop in sales, with declines in every major category. Sales of sedans were down nearly 26 percent.Ford also posted a decline of nearly 9 percent for sales of its best-selling, and highly profitable, F-Series pickup trucks and a 2.7 percent drop in sales of SUVs.In a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve referred to September as a ""tale of two hurricanes.""""Hurricane Florence was a big factor this month,"" LaNeve said, adding that post-storm recovery efforts were ""moving quickly.""General Motors Co (N:GM) said its third-quarter sales were down 11.1 percent versus the same period in 2017. Earlier this year, the No. 1 U.S. automaker stopped reporting monthly sales, arguing that a 30-day snapshot did not accurately portray market trends.Sales were down at all of GM's major brands, with particularly sharp decreases for passenger cars.""Our brands are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter when our next wave of new products start shipping in high volume,"" Kurt McNeil, GM U.S. vice president for sales, said in a news release.GM has high hopes for all-new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 10.4 percent in September. Sedan sales at the Japanese automaker were off nearly 28 percent. That included a 17 percent decline for its flagship Camry midsize sedan, which was completely redesigned with the aim of increasing market share.Toyota's SUV and pickup truck sales were down 0.3 percent for the month.Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 12.2 percent drop in sales for September, with a 35.7 percent decline in passenger car sales more than offsetting a 6.6 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.Sales of Nissan's best-selling vehicle, the Rogue crossover, fell 10.6 percent in September.""It was a tough comparison for sales year-over-year, but otherwise the month was very solid for us with some bright spots,"" said Billy Hayes, the automaker’s vice president for regional operations in North America. ""We're still extremely bullish and we're feeling very good about the rest of the year.""Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said sales were off 7 percent in September, as a 19 percent decrease in passenger cars outmatched a 6.3 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.Monthly sales of the automaker's completely revamped Accord dropped by 15 percent.Ford shares closed 1.3 percent lower at $9.20 on Tuesday.

"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send messages to more than 200 million U.S. cellphones on Wednesday testing a previously unused presidential alert system that aims to warn the public in the event of a national emergency.The test message was originally scheduled for September but was pushed back to Wednesday at 2:18 p.m. EDT. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which will send the alert, said the messages would bear the headline “Presidential Alert,” and that phones will make a loud tone and have a special vibration.The test has been scheduled to ensure that the alert system would work in the event of a national emergency. The message will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” A separate alert on TV and radios will be issued at 2:20 p.m..The tests have drawn a lot of attention on social media in part because of President Donald Trump's propensity for sending tweets to his 55 million followers. On a conference call, government officials told reporters that Trump would not personally trigger the alert -- from his phone or any other device -- and emphasized that no president could ""wake up one morning and attempt to send a personal message.""The test alert will be sent by a device similar to a laptop from a FEMA laboratory.An actual alert would be used for an impending missile attack or other national emergency. Then-President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 requiring FEMA to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies.Federal Communications Commissioner Mike O'Rielly told reporters on Tuesday that an April 5 regional test of the emergency alert system in the Washington area showed some potential issues. He said some people did not receive alerts on some devices during that test. ""We're trying to analyze that,"" O'Rielly said.The country's wireless emergency alert system has issued over 36,000 alerts for situations such as missing children, extreme weather and natural disasters since 2012, but never a presidential directive.Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts, but not presidential alerts.  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said nearly all of its mobile phone handsets are capable of getting alerts.Government officials estimated that the alert would reach upwards of 225 million U.S. cellphones, or around 75 percent of all phones. They said a person on a call lasting 30 minutes may not get the alert as with phones with an active data connection. ",1,2
"By Maiya Keidan and Kirstin RidleyLONDON (Reuters) - As the hedge funds once clustered in London's Mayfair negotiate gyrating markets, they are facing a new line of investor questioning: who has contracted COVID-19?With billions sometimes riding on the performance of one star manager, or a small constellation of talent, investor interest in delving into the medical status of staff -- a realm considered by many private -- is perhaps understandable during a pandemic.""The important thing for managers is planning – what do they intend to do on the basis of when, not if, they get the virus,"" said one of three investors who told Reuters they wanted to be informed about any coronavirus infections at the hedge funds they invest with.But most of Britain's hedge fund managers have no protocol for divulging such details and there are no specific legal requirements for them to do so, according to Samuel Brooks, a partner at law firm Macfarlanes.As many infected by the novel coronavirus appear to show only mild symptoms, some hedge funds – normally based in the well-heeled west London enclave but now scattered and working from home – are taking a ‘need to know’ approach to staff health disclosures.They say they would only tell investors if their top managers fell seriously ill, but not necessarily inform them of a mild infection, or if lower-ranking staff became sick, according to interviews.""You have a duty to your investors to advise them should any of your key employees or senior management fall ill with anything that incapacitates them beyond a reasonable period of time,"" said Kristofer Tremaine, founder and CIO at trade finance hedge fund Kimura Capital.""Admission to hospital with COVID-19 would fall into that category.""James Sivyer, an analyst at hedge fund data and analysis firm HFM, said the consensus view among 25 hedge funds was that the disease was now so widespread that a mild case would almost be a non-event -- and none he had spoken with had notified or planned to notify end investors about such infections.Regulated British finance firms are obliged to report any material issues impacting their businesses and have to pay ""due regard"" to the interests of their customers under Financial Conduct Authority rules.Where funds can be managed by a variety of people, and are advertised as such, their obligation to notify investors about staff absences depends in part on their prospectus, succession plans and any individual agreements with investors, regulatory experts say.""We sometimes see investment managers being required to provide this type of information because of how they have described the portfolio being run in their prospectus,"" said Devarshi Saksena, partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons.The risks of having so many assets tied to the performance of one person or a small group of people -- known as 'key person risk' -- has long been an issue in the hedge fund industry, where a star manager can attract billions from investors.Big, influential and early investors may manage such risks with additional agreements called side letters, that can allow for greater transparency, although some regulators have raised concerns about their use.Nevertheless, some hedge funds are adamant that things would need to get critical before they divulge staff medical details. One portfolio manager, who declined to be named, said he would have to be at death's door before investors were informed.""If I were going to die from it then, yes, we would tell our investors,"" he said.

"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Can this rally be trusted?Europe’s stock markets had time on their hands to consider that question early Friday, as traders were content to stay on the sidelines ahead of the all-important U.S. labor market report for August at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).By 5 AM, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was largely unchanged at 385.98 but still on course for a weekly gain of nearly 2% after Thursday’s rally. It’s now made good nearly all the losses incurred since President Donald Trump’s fateful tweet at the start of August which triggered a round of tit-for-tat escalations of the trade war.By the same token, the German DAX was up 0.1%, also at its highest since early August, while the FTSE 100 was unchanged.Luxury names outperformed on more signs of a potential de-escalation of the protest in Hong Kong, which accounts for a disproportional amount of sales and profit at groups such as Burberry and Gucci owner Kering.Elsewhere, all was becalmed, with another set of gloomy German industrial production data keeping any optimism firmly in check. With incoming orders to German factories also falling in July, the first “hard” data of the third quarter from Europe’s largest economy have pointed clearly to a second straight quarter of contraction in the summer.“Since reunification there have been four comparable industrial setbacks of which three ended in a recession,” Allianz economist Katharina Utermoehl said via Twitter. However, she pointed to one key difference with the last recession in 2008/9, which is that the addition of 6 million jobs to the German economy in the last decade has left consumption structurally stronger.With no turnaround in sight in the euro zone economy (second-quarter GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2% on Friday), much is now resting on the outcome of the European Central Bank’s policy meeting next week.“Even if (the German data) come too late to be incorporated into next week’s official ECB forecasts, it will be another argument for ECB members in favor of new monetary stimulus,” said Carsten Brzeski.Most analysts expect the ECB to cut its discount rate by 0.1% or 0.2%, and to adjust the price of its new long-term loans to as to keep short-term interest rates anchored lower. The big open question is whether it will renew its purchases of bonds, given that a vocal minority of central bankers from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have all voiced resistance to the idea in the last week.",1,2

"(Bloomberg) -- Baker Hughes, the Houston-based oilfield services business, agreed to buy a 5 percent stake in Adnoc Drilling, a deal that values the unit of government-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. at about $11 billion.The investment marks the first time that an international partner takes a direct equity stake in an existing Adnoc services business, the companies said Monday in a joint statement. The valuation of Adnoc Drilling includes about $1 billion of net debt.Baker Hughes, a GE company, will provide specialized equipment and technologies to Adnoc Drilling, which supplies oil rigs to other Adnoc businesses and is the Middle East’s largest drilling company, they said. The agreement may help Adnoc Drilling expand outside the United Arab Emirates, an OPEC producer in which the emirate of Abu Dhabi holds most of the oil, the companies said.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking to boost supply to offset a decline in oil exports from Iran, due to U.S. sanctions, and plummeting production in Venezuela. The increase has yet to significantly reduce prices, with Brent crude 25 percent higher this year.Faster DrillingThe partnership with Baker Hughes “comes at an important time in the drilling needs of Abu Dhabi as Adnoc grows its conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources and as we see future potential for further regional growth,” Adnoc Chief Executive Officer Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said.Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said the deal will help “drive predictable revenue streams and long-term growth for both companies and lets us invest in a stable, reliable and secure market environment.”The partnership aims to help Adnoc boost its conventional drilling activity by 40 percent by 2025, increase the number of its unconventional wells and reach its target of reducing drilling time by 30 percent by the end of 2019, according to the statement. Having a single company provide all necessary services will prove “transformative” for Adnoc, said Robin Mills, chief executive officer of Dubai-based consultant Qamar Energy.“We needed to get away from operating in different silos, from different contractors working the well,” Abdul Munim Al Kindy, director of Adnoc upstream and chairman of Adnoc Drilling, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. The agreement with Baker Hughes “is about removing the interfaces between different services that go to complete a well and integrate it all in one company,” he said.The deal will close in the fourth quarter, upon regulatory approval, and Baker Hughes will hold a seat on Adnoc Drilling’s board of directors, the companies said.Moelis & Co. is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Adnoc in the transaction, while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is advising Baker Hughes.(Updates with analyst in seventh paragraph; Adnoc Drilling chairman in eighth.)",1,1

"(Bloomberg) -- As the U.K. mulls further action against Russia in response to a nerve agent attack on a former spy on British soil, the question of whether policymakers should go after the bond market is back on the table.Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure from some U.K. lawmakers to look into Russia’s sovereign debt. The issue is “extremely important” and officials are monitoring the matter very closely, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.But like their U.S. colleagues before them, U.K. policymakers may find this isn’t a path they’re prepared, or able, to go down. Here’s why:Britain Can’t Act AloneOne option would be to put pressure on the two big European clearing houses to restrict them from processing new Russian bond sales. But neither is incorporated in the U.K., so Theresa May would need approval from her European counterparts for an EU-wide ban.“The U.K. cannot force Euroclear or Clearstream to refuse the clearing of Russian bonds,” said Viktor Szabo, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. “It can try to impose EU sanctions on the Russian sovereign debt, which would have this effect, but I see this as unlikely at the moment.”When, in 2016, Russia sold its first Eurobond since sanctions were imposed on individuals and industries over the Crimea crisis, Belgium-based Euroclear SA didn’t initially agree to handle it. Clearstream International SA hasn’t processed new Russian debt sales since 2013. The 2016 sale went ahead anyway and most foreign investors bought the bond when Euroclear accepted it two months later. Both clearing houses declined to comment on whether they would respond to pressure from the U.K. government over Russia.Dependency Goes Both WaysImposing restrictions on Russian sovereign debt markets would push down prices of the country’s outstanding bonds. Since many of those assets are owned by international investors, including British pension funds, the U.K. would be shooting itself in the foot through its penalties. Investec Plc, Legal & General Group (LON:LGEN) Plc and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc are British money managers listed among the biggest holders of Russian Eurobonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Russia Can Survive Without DebtIn some respects, the sanctions imposed on Russian companies and individuals in 2014 showed that Russia can always muddle through on its own. Those restrictions forced the country to cut down on borrowing (albeit at the expense of economic growth), giving it a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 14 percent, one of the lowest in the world. Thanks to higher oil prices, the Finance Ministry may add about $35 billion to its rainy-day fund this year.If Russia’s sovereign debt is sanctioned, the Finance Ministry would simply reduce borrowing, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview with Russian TV Rain aired on Thursday.The U.S. Already Decided It’s Not Worth ItThe U.S. Treasury already looked into sanctioning Russian debt markets in response to alleged interference in the 2016 elections. Their conclusion: it would be too damaging for global markets. Their report on the subject published in February concluded that preventing American investors from buying Russian sovereign debt would hinder the competitiveness of asset managers.“Because Russia’s economy has extensive real- and financial-sector linkages to global businesses and investors, the effects of the sanctions would not be limited to Russian authorities and business,” the report concluded.",1,2
"By Tina BellonNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday denied a request by an Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc customer to overturn an arbitration win for the company in a price-fixing case over claims the arbitrator only ruled in Uber's favor because he was scared.U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said the claim was without merit, with the arbitrator, Les Weinstein, simply joking when he said he dismissed the lawsuit in February and said he acted out of fear.""After carefully reviewing the full record, the court finds that the arbitrator's concluding remarks, rather than a sincere confession of fear, were simply an attempt at humor - one of many made by the arbitrator throughout the hearing,"" Rakoff wrote on Monday. Spencer Meyer initiated the high-profile 2015 antitrust lawsuit alleging Uber engaged in an illegal conspiracy with its drivers to coordinate high ""surge pricing"" fares during periods of heavy demand by agreeing to charge prices set by an algorithm in the Uber ride-hailing app.The lawsuit sought a nationwide ban against surge pricing. A ruling against the company would have threatened Uber's business, which takes a cut from drivers' earnings.The company argues its drivers are independent contractors and that its app is merely a technology platform connecting drivers with passengers. After going through several courts, the lawsuit was sent into arbitration in 2019 in accordance with Uber's terms of service. Weinstein, the arbitrator, dismissed Spencer's lawsuit on Feb. 22. According to court transcripts, he concluded his ruling by saying: ""I must say I act out of fear. My fear is if I ruled Uber illegal, I would need security. I wouldn't be able to walk the streets at night. People would be after me.""Spencer in May asked Rakoff to overturn the ruling, arguing Weinstein had displayed ""evident partiality."" ",1,2
"By Siddharth Cavale(Reuters) - Shares in  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB) rose on Friday after the U.S. health regulator exempted menthol and tobacco from a list of popular e-cigarette flavors that it has banned under new guidelines.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said e-cigarette makers will be banned from selling pod-based e-cigarette flavors, including fruit, dessert and mint, in the United States from February. The ban was less stringent than one U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed in September, when he threatened to remove all flavors, including menthol, from all types of e-cigarettes to curb a teenage vaping epidemic.BAT shares rose as much as 2.5% and were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) where many shares were hit by heightened tensions in the Middle East.Imperial Brands was also among the handful of gainers, with its shares up 1.4%. Fears of an outright ban led BAT and Imperial to lower their growth forecasts for their U.S. vaping businesses last year. ""Following a significant period of disruption and uncertainty, this regulatory clarity is a welcome step towards returning the U.S. vapor market to stability,"" BAT, the maker of Lucky Strike, Dunhill and Vuse e-cigarettes, said on Friday.The new FDA guidelines would also allow tobacco makers to bring back some of the banned flavors if their marketing applications passed a substantive review by the FDA.This removed some ambiguity related to the future of the exempted products, Simon Evans, spokesman for Imperial Brands said. ""In addition to exempting menthol, the FDA guidance is clear that flavored products will return to the market once they have been approved through the Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) process,"" he said. Brokerage Jefferies said that while vaping sales would take a near-term hit from the new rules, the overall financial impact for BAT and Imperial would be minimal as most users would either switch to menthol or tobacco, or even to higher-margin traditional tobacco products.""We are actually bullish on implications of this final guidance,"" Jefferies said. BAT submitted a marketing application for its Vuse Solo e-cigarette to the FDA in November, while Imperial said it would submit its applications for its Blu e-cigarettes before May.  ",1,2

"By David RandallNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled slightly more than $5 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, ending what had been the largest rush into domestic stocks since 2016, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.The retreat from the U.S. stock market came after investors had pushed $17.9 billion into funds that hold domestic stocks over the two previous weeks, and was the first move away from U.S. stocks since the $8.2 billion decline in net assets during the week that ended June 5.Investors have pulled a total of $35.6 billion out of U.S. stock funds since the start of the year despite a rally that has pushed the S&P 500 up more than 19% to new record highs. The move has been fueled largely by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, making equities more attractive by lowering company and consumer borrowing costs.Bond funds continued to rake in new assets despite the prospect of lower interest rates. Taxable and municipal debt funds brought in slightly more than $10.5 billion in new assets, continuing a streak in which the category has pulled in $213.4 billion since the beginning of the year.World stocks, meanwhile, lost $3.4 billion in net outflows, leaving the category down nearly $13.1 billion for the year to date.",1,2

"By Alexandria SageSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Thursday it would not be profitable in the first quarter, as it offered for the first time a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only, steps designed to increase demand and cut overhead costs for the electric vehicle maker.Chief Executive Elon Musk's warning on profit during a conference call with members of the media, which did not include Reuters, contrasted with Tesla's statements last month that it was expecting a ""very small"" net profit in the first quarter. Shares of Tesla fell 3.4 percent after hours. Investors have voiced concerns about whether Tesla would be able to maintain profit margins through cost cutting - such as recent layoffs - as it reduces prices of its newest vehicle.Still, the price drop could quell concerns from some analysts that demand for the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 was beginning to dry up in the United States, especially after a federal tax credit was cut in half this year.""Tesla wants to drum up demand,"" said Elazar Advisors' Chaim Siegel. ""There was a slowdown in the U.S. as the tax credits dropped. (There are) more tax credit hits later in the year too so they are trying to be proactive.""Musk has often shared that his strategy for Tesla was to build higher-priced cars - the Model S and X - whose success would ultimately usher in a $35,000 mass-market car, followed by an SUV, the Model Y, which is currently in development. But customers who reserved the Model 3 at that lower price have waited nearly three years since Musk first promised it. An online-only sales strategy, along with other changes, would allow vehicle prices to fall by about 6 percent on average, Tesla said in a blog on its website https:// Over the next few months, Tesla will wind down ""many"" of its stores, while investing in its service system, it said.Online-only sales represent a dramatic shift for the company that has prided itself on its boutique retail stores. In June 2017, Musk pledged to increase the number of stores, saying they had ""barely touched the surface"" of what was possible. As of the fourth quarter, Tesla said it recently opened 27 new locations, bringing its total of stores and service centers to 378. Thursday was the third time this year that Tesla lowered the price on the Model 3, which recently started at $42,900. The new $35,000 version has a top speed of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) and can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, Tesla said. For $2,000 more, Tesla offers a version with a range of 240 miles (386 km) and a top speed of 140 mph.GAME CHANGER WITH SPEED BUMPS A $35,000 Model 3 is a major shot in the arm for Tesla sales during a period of major challenges, including deliveries of the Model 3 to Europe and China and construction of a factory in Shanghai.""This is a game changer,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Since tax credits will continue to decline over 2019, ""this is really exactly what the doctor ordered,"" he said.He warned, however, there could be ""more speed bumps ahead,"" if more sales volume exacerbates prior problems with deliveries and service to customers. Musk declined to answer a question on what the profit margins of the $35,000 vehicle would be, according to the New York Times. Gross margins on the car were above 20 percent in the fourth quarter. ""The margin on the vehicle obviously is going to be very small if there's any margin there at all,"" said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which has a short position in Tesla.As part of cost-cutting efforts, Tesla last month reduced its full-time headcount by 7 percent, following a similar cut of 9 percent to its workforce in June 2018.The price cut on the Model 3 comes three days after renewed tensions between Musk and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency petitioned a judge this week to have Tesla's CEO found in contempt of an October settlement between the parties. The SEC accuses Musk of having made material statements about production levels on Twitter without first having them vetted internally. That settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC concerned Musk's August Twitter post in which he claimed to have ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. On Friday, Tesla is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $40 below the $359.87 conversion price. Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December. ",0,0

"By Claire MilhenchLONDON (Reuters) - British investors increased their equity exposure in August from July's nine-month lows, favoring emerging markets after a shake-out in the sector, but cut UK assets as the risk of a no-deal Brexit grew.Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 17 UK-based asset managers was conducted Aug. 16-28 as world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) climbed to a six-month high. U.S. equities (SPX) (IXIC) also set record highs after a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) raised hopes that a global trade war could be averted.Most participants completed the poll before the accord was announced, but the mood was still more bullish than it had been in July when trade war concern sapped investor confidence.""The global economy remains in a period of synchronized economic growth and despite some weakness in the eurozone, continues to gather momentum,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust.In the poll, British managers raised their global equity exposure to 51.2 percent from 50.4 percent in July. They cut cash by 1.6 percentage points to 4.4 percent, the lowest level in at least five years. Mark Shields, investment director for the multi-asset team at Brooks Macdonald, was among those overweighting risk assets: ""Premiums in valuations in the U.S. are warranted in our view given the strong consumer backdrop, earnings momentum and the pace of economic expansion,"" he said.The U.S. stocks allocation held at last month's 34 percent, the highest in nearly two years. Investors also ramped up their exposure to emerging-market stocks to 18.4 percent from July's 16.3 percent, after a turbulent month.Emerging-market equities (MSCIEF) are down over 9 percent year-to-date, clobbered by trade war fears and rising U.S. interest rates. Emerging-market currencies sold off again in August as crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified and rising U.S. sanctions risk hit Russia.The lira  is now down over 40 percent year-to-date, crushed by Turkey's loose monetary and fiscal policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. But poll participants who answered a question on the currency's travails were split over whether the lira had troughed. Forty-one 41 percent said it hadn't, a third said it had, and a quarter were undecided.TIME TO BUYThere was more agreement over whether it was time to buy emerging-market assets. Two-thirds of those who answered that question agreed. Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth, noted the assets looked cheap compared with developed- market debt and equities. ""The recent sell-off represents an attractive new entry level,"" he said, arguing that fears of contagion from Argentina, Brazil and Turkey to other markets was unjustified. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, also saw more positives than negatives for emerging markets in coming months. He acknowledged risks in Turkey, Venezuela and Brazil but added: ""We have seen strong profits growth for the EM complex, and better valuations encourage us to look for buying opportunities.""UK assets were shunned, with sterling hitting a one-year low versus the euro in August as fears over a no-deal Brexit grew.Investors slashed their UK equity exposure by 3.6 percentage points to 21.2 percent, the lowest level since April 2015. UK bond holdings also fell to 21.5 percent, the lowest since May.""With Brexit moving ever closer and uncertainty remaining, many UK investors have moved to the side of caution,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum, noting that overseas investors also appeared to be shying away from the UK.

"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it was putting 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision (SZ:002415) - on a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.Those added to the so-called ""Entity List"" include the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region People’s Government Public Security Bureau, 19 subordinate government agencies and eight commercial firms, according to a Commerce Department filing. The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology (SZ:002236), IFLYTEK Co (SZ:002230),  Xiamen Meiya Pico Information  Co (SZ:300188) and Yixin Science and Technology Co.Reuters reported on the planned additions earlier Monday, before the Commerce Department made it official.The department filing said the ""entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.""U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to this week's resumption of trade talks with China. Being added to the ""Entity List"" bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.The Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List.Hikvision, officially known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world’s largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.Hikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department's move.John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia, Ambarella,  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagates as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be “devastating."" Shares in Ambarella fell more than 9% on the news.In August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government's restrictions.",0,0

"By Nate Raymond(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, facing a wave of lawsuits blaming it for helping fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, said on Wednesday it had laid off about 350 employees this week including the remainder of its already-downsized sales force.The Stamford, Connecticut-based pharmaceutical manufacturer said about half of the affected employees were part of its sales force, which had already seen cuts announced in February when Purdue said it would stop promoting opioids to physicians.At the time, Purdue said its remaining 200 sales representatives would focus on promoting on non-opioid products. The layoffs, adding to 380 employees who left the company earlier this year, will leave Purdue with about 550 employees as the company says it is shifting to focus on pursuing new drugs. ""Purdue Pharma is taking significant steps to transform and diversify beyond our historic focus of pain medications,"" Purdue said in a statement. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in the United States in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Privately-held Purdue and other opioid manufacturers have been fighting hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities accusing the companies of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing. The lawsuits have generally accused Purdue of deceiving doctors and patients by misrepresenting the risks of addiction and death associated with the prolonged use of its prescription opioids. The company denies the allegations.While Purdue has engaged in settlement talks with a group of state attorneys general conducting an investigation into it and other opioid manufacturers, a growing number of states have chosen to instead take the company to court.In total, Purdue faces lawsuits by 24 states and the territory of Puerto Rico.Most recently, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey on June 12 sued Purdue and 16 current or former Purdue executives and board members, including members of the wealthy Sackler family, which owns the company.Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties.Sales of OxyContin have been declining in recent years. OxyContin generated $1.74 billion in sales in 2017, down from $2.6 billion five years earlier, according to data compiled by Symphony Health Solutions.Purdue continues to sell opioids. It has been directing doctors with opioid-related questions to its medical affairs department.(This version of the story corrects spelling of Stamford in second paragraph) ",0,0

"(Bloomberg) -- New-home sales in the U.S. jumped to the highest level in almost 14 years in July as low mortgage rates helped fuel a suburban construction boom.Purchases of new single-family houses climbed 13.9% from June to a 901,000 annualized pace from an upwardly revised 791,000, government data showed Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 790,000 rate of sales. The median selling price rose 7.2% from a year earlier to $330,600.Sales of new houses have taken off during the pandemic because borrowing costs have never been lower and listings for previously owned homes are in short supply. Shoppers want quarantine comforts, such as backyards and room for offices. And builders are shifting to lower-priced offerings, expanding the pool of potential buyers.“It has been a rocket ship up since May,” said Rick Palacios, director of research at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which advises builders. “Demand is insatiable right now.”The market is so strong that builders are having to raise prices to slow down the pace of sales and ensure they won’t blow through inventory, Palacios said. About 70% of builders surveyed by John Burns Real Estate last month said they increased prices, compared with just 27% in the previous July.Three out of four major U.S. regions showed higher sales of new homes in July. Purchases surged 58.8% in the Midwest, climbed 13% in the South and 7.8% in the West. Sales fell 23.1% in the Northeast.The supply of new homes at the current sales pace was four months.An S&P index of homebuilder shares, which had rallied 30% this year, fell 0.8% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, maintaining earlier declines.(Updates with regional performance in sixth paragraph.)©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",1,1

Hover text is when users place their cursor over certain text to get additional information on a website.CMA had also stated that the company was selling tickets with resale restrictions, misleading on availability of tickets and non-disclosure of certain seat numbers.The watchdog had said in July that it would take further legal action against the company for contempt of court following concerns that it had failed to comply fully with an earlier court order.""Viagogo has now addressed the UK competition authority's outstanding concerns about how it presents information,"" the CMA said on Thursday.It added that a further independent review of Viagogo's compliance with the court order will be completed in October, and if results suggests the company is not meeting its obligations then the CMA could take further action – through the courts if necessary.The secondary ticketing market, which resells tickets for events ranging from pop concerts to tennis and soccer matches, has come under fire from politicians and regulators for sometimes sky-high prices and misleading customers.""Viagogo is pleased it has been able to work with the CMA to find solutions to the final few areas of discussion ...

"By Chris GallagherFUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Sunday said it was vital that  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor strengthen their alliance as the auto industry undergoes rapid change in the areas of electric and connected vehicles.Speaking after a meeting of G20 finance ministers in the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, Le Maire noted the synergies Renault has enjoyed with its Japanese partner which could help them take the lead in 21st century technologies.""Looking at the past 20 years, we see that this quality of Renault has been reinforced by its partnership with Nissan,"" he told reporters.""Therefore it is essential not only to preserve, but to strengthen this alliance. That has always been the strategy of the state and it remains the strategy of the state as shareholder.""Le Maire said the previous day in an interview with Agence France Presse that the French government was ready to reduce its 15% stake in Renault in the interest of bolstering the automaker's alliance with Nissan Motor.That comment came just days after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) withdrew its $35 billion merger offer for Renault blaming ""political conditions in France.""The French government had welcomed the merger plan but went too far by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that exhausted the patience of FCA, sources told Reuters.Le Maire did not answer directly when asked if he would discuss the topic of the government's Renault stake with his Japanese counterparts on a visit to Tokyo the next day.""It's a long-term horizon. I think for now, it's wise to stick to the short and medium term,"" he said, reiterating the importance of beefing up the alliance.Le Maire's visit to Japan comes amid a period of strained relations between Renault and Nissan, after the arrest of former boss and alliance architect Carlos Ghosn in November.But the unequal relationship between them - smaller Renault has the bigger stake in Nissan - has long been a source of friction. Renault owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan has a 15% stake in its French partner.Le Maire will visit Tokyo on Monday to meet with business leaders and government officials including Finance Minister Taro Aso.

"By Marcelo RochabrunSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's oldest factory in Brazil, slated for closure later this year, was a giant among auto plants, occupying a sprawling 12 million square feet (111.5 hectares), bigger than many of the automaker's U.S. facilities.But in terms of spare capacity, the most important indicator of factory profitability, the historic Sao Bernardo do Campo plant, which still employs 3,000 workers, had become a dwarf. Closed more often than it was open, the plant's production lines sprang to life just three days a week. Ford announced on Tuesday it will close the factory and exit its heavy commercial truck business in South America as part of a global restructuring. Overall, Ford's Sao Bernardo plant produced 33,000 cars and heavy trucks in 2018, or just 11 vehicles per employee.An industry rule of thumb says an auto factory struggles to turn a profit unless it uses at least 80 percent of its capacity. In 2018, Ford used 12 percent of its car production capacity at the Sao Bernardo plant. In Brazil as a whole, Ford used 58 percent of its total production capacity last year, leaning heavily on a plant in the northeastern state of Bahia, where it receives significant tax incentives. Productivity troubles in Brazil are perhaps most severe at Ford but plague the industry as a whole, even as Latin America's largest economy rebounds from its deepest recession ever with double-digit growth in car sales.General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), now Brazil's sales market leader, produced cars equivalent to 78 percent of its capacity in 2018, up from 56 percent two years earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on capacity figures GM disclosed and production figures from local industry association Anfavea. Still, GM executives warned workers earlier this year that the company was experiencing ""a critical moment"" in the country amid heavy losses. Another top domestic producer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, produced cars equivalent to just 47 percent of its overall capacity, up from 36 percent in 2016, according to a similar calculation.Ford's heavy truck business, which will be discontinued in South America, operated at 19 percent capacity, according to Ford's own figures. The company said it could find ""no viable path to profitability"" for the unit. ""We know Brazil has excess capacity,"" said Leticia Costa, a Brazilian consultant and auto industry expert. ""This is a global problem for the auto industry but it's particularly true for emerging markets.""BOOM DAYS IN BRAZILBrazilians' mushrooming disposable income, along with hefty import barriers, encouraged automakers - led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG - to set up shop there and produce cars locally starting in the late 1950s. That turned Sao Paulo's industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo into the epicenter of what for a time was one of the world's top five auto producers. Volkswagen, whose Beetle was the market's sales leader in the industry's early boom days, did not respond to a request for comment on its capacity. But the high costs of local production and dependence on what turned out to be a fickle domestic market also sowed the seeds of the industry's hollowing out and dispersal into newer plants in far-flung states. The severe economic recession that began around 2013 hammered local producers. While the industry is recovering, it is still far behind its peak.But some plants can now build cars more efficiently. Ford's second plant in Bahia produces six times more cars than the Sao Bernardo plant, with 53 percent more workers, according to the company's website.""Fixed costs at that scale are sky-high,"" said David Wong, a management consultant and Brazilian auto industry expert.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will commit $10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he said on Monday.Cutting emissions will be challenging for Amazon. The e-commerce company delivers 10 billion items a year, has a massive transportation and data center footprint, and has faced criticism from within its own workforce.Bezos, the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires to dedicate substantial funds to battling the impact of global warming. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share."" The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants this summer as part of the initiative.""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said. Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for U.S. billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft's Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣ Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from U.S. vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands. Amazon has faced protests by environmental activists and pressure from its employees to take action on climate change.Amazon workers were among hundreds of employees of big technology companies to join climate-change marches in San Francisco and Seattle late last year, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action.Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an activist workers group, welcomed the Bezos Earth Fund announcement, but said it did not make up for the company's consumption of fossil fuels and other activities that contribute to climate change.""We applaud Jeff Bezos' philanthropy, but one hand cannot give what the other is taking away,"" the group said on Twitter.

"By Ann SaphirSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The first public report on climate-related risks to financial markets ever commissioned by a U.S. market regulator will be out in June, the head of the group charged with writing it said on Wednesday. The report, by a 35-member panel formed last month by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ""will address both the short-term financial risks that may be associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, as well as the current and future market and financial risks associated with the physical risks that will arise from a warming climate,"" Bob Litterman, a partner at hedge fund Kepos Capital and the panel's chair, said at a public meeting held at the CFTC's Washington headquarters.It will include policy recommendations on oversight, including disclosures and stress testing against climate events, as well as ideas for new products for hedging against climate risk, he said, adding, ""Today the incentives around the world go in the wrong direction, and this has to change.""Regulators in Europe have begun to weave climate risks into their supervision of markets and banks. But U.S. regulators have been slow to respond to the threats that a warming planet can pose to financial assets. These include frequent wildfires and destructive hurricanes which may jeopardize the value of assets that underlie the trillions of dollars bought and sold in the world's biggest financial markets and the farmers, banks and insurers that use those markets.The Trump administration has sought to undercut a broad swath of U.S. and state regulations aimed at combating climate change and limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that cause it.In June, Rostin Behnam, one of two Democrats on the five-member CFTC, signaled he wanted to change that, announcing he would form a subcommittee to examine how climate change threatens not only the derivatives markets his agency oversees but the stability of the broader financial system.""No one else in the public sector is doing this,"" Behnam said in an interview this week. “I don't view this as a partisan issue.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess on Thursday said a victory by Democrat Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential race would better suit the German carmaker's efforts to mass produce electric cars across the globe.""A Democratic programme would be more aligned with our worldwide strategy to fight climate change to go electric,"" Diess said on a Bloomberg webcast on Thursday.Presidential candidate Joe Biden moved closer to victory in the U.S. election as officials continued to tally votes in the handful of key battleground states that will determine the outcome.VW is in the midst of a global push to launch electric vehicles in China, the United States and Europe, and is betting on economies of scale to make battery-driven cars more affordable.""The United States, when it comes to market share, is the weakest region in the world,"" Diess said.Diess added that Volkswagen had established a trustful relationship with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and that the prospect of trade tensions between the United States and other parts of the world would remain even if Biden won.Policymakers from all parties are determined to rebalance trade relations, in an effort to bring investment and jobs back to the United States, Diess explained.""The discussions would remain - you always have trade balances, which are a concern for some nations,"" he said. ",1,2
"By Nick Carey(Reuters) - Delivery fleet operators face regulatory pressure in California and other states to buy electric vehicles, but a surge in package deliveries thanks to coronavirus lockdowns has major firms itching to switch to electric right now.And they want far more than just battery-powered versions of diesel- or gas-guzzling trucks and vans. Fleet operators such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) hunger for computers on wheels that can harvest data and upgrade safety or autonomous features overnight to save money and boost profit.""For us, it's not just about making the wheels turn with a zero-emission vehicle,"" said Scott Phillippi, UPS's senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, who envisions ""Tesla-like"" vehicles in the company's vast fleet. ""It's about an integrated-technology vehicle - and that's really what we're pushing for.""With its ability to send wireless upgrades and fixes to customers' electric cars, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is seen as a bellwether for electrification. Major companies like UPS want to harness that power to bring cost-saving, autonomous or safety measures to their fleets in real time.If, for instance, a manufacturer developed a feature to prevent a truck from bumping into a loading dock, UPS could have it in tens of thousands of vehicles overnight to prevent expensive dents, Phillippi said.UPS, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and other e-commerce delivery companies are both creating and shaping the emerging market for electric vans and trucks. Economics and competitive advantages created by data will drive the market for electric commercial vehicles.Demand for electric commercial vehicles is accelerating in part because battery range, long a concern for fleets, has improved dramatically, while battery costs have fallen. UPS has ordered 10,000 vans from UK startup Arrival Ltd - the majority for the U.S. market - in which UPS also owns a minority stake. Arrival is working on self-driving technology, which is one reason why UPS is supporting the company, UPS's Phillippi said.The company has also reserved 125 of Tesla's long-awaited Semi big rigs, 50 electric trucks from Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) - with an option for 950 more - and is testing electric trucks with California startup Xos.Tesla's Semi was due to go into production in 2019, but is now slated for 2021. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans last year from startup Rivian Automotive LLC - in which it has invested - and ordered 1,800 more from  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz car and vans division for its European fleet last month.While demand is soaring, supply is still virtually non-existent and production has been beset by delays.""Ultimately, there's no trucks available yet,"" Phillippi said. ""We're just waiting for vehicles to show up.""The pressure is rising for manufacturers to deliver. Startups such as Rivian and Arrival are racing with larger, established vehicle makers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM) to get electric trucks into production.Startup Xos Trucks, for example, has begun low-volume production of vans with Mexican auto supplier Metalsa [MSDC.UL], a part-owner and strategic partner, using a ""modular"" battery approach where battery packs are added based on a customer's range needs. Xos Trucks Chief Executive Dakota Semler recounts the recent reaction of a customer when told their vehicles would be delivered in 2021. ""They said, 'What do I have to do get it by the end of this year?'"" Semler said.'ACTIVELY RAISING CAPITAL'The years-long journey of one electric delivery vehicle startup, California-based Chanje Energy Inc, shows the challenges vehicle makers and their customers face creating a new industry on the fly. California's decision in June to require commercial truck manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024, drew attention to the market. But Bryan Hansel, Chanje's CEO, said California's mandate made little difference. The surge in e-commerce delivery caused by the coronavirus pandemic had already caused fleet operators to zero in on the 50 miles per gallon (80 km per gallon) equivalent his vans offer versus the 6 to 8 mpg averaged by conventional diesel trucks.Back in 2018, package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) ordered 1,000 Chanje vans. But Chanje had to pause while its battery supplier, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ:300750), updated its batteries' energy density. That boosted the range of Chanje's vehicles to 150 miles from 100 miles. Its 2021 model should have a range of 200 miles, Hansel said, making it capable of handling 90% of U.S. last-mile delivery routes - the ""last-mile"" of e-commerce where drivers drop off packages at individual consumers' doors is typically the most expensive.Chanje had to tackle other problems. Like other fleet operators, FedEx is not a fueling company - conventional fleets send vehicles to gas stations to fill up - so it lacked chargers for a large fleet. So Chanje became an energy services company, building out overhead charging stations at 20 FedEx depots across California to charge all 1,000 vans it will deliver in the first half of 2021.Chanje also has stepped up its software and electronics capability. After drivers reported the vehicles would roll backward if they took their foot off the accelerator on a hill, Chanje spent four weeks rewriting the code with a software fix. Then, according to Hansel, the company ""just flashed it over the wire to every truck we've ever built."" Chanje's vans are assembled in China by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (HK:0729), currently its main investor. ""But we are actively in the market raising capital because the capital markets seem to be very interested in the EV space right now,"" Hansel said. ",1,2

"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares tumbled to their lowest in nearly three years on Thursday after the company unveiled a wretched set of figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, hit by falling operating margins and big writedowns on investments in North American shale gas and elsewhere.The hit was so severe that the Anglo-Dutch giant said it would slow the pace of share buybacks to only $1 billion in the current quarter, from an average of $2.5 billion a quarter over the last 18 months. In the three months to December, it had bought $2.8 billion, but that had only been made possible by allowing the debt reduction target to slip. Gearing, the ratio of debt to equity, rose to 29.3% from 27.9% three months earlier – drifting further away from its medium-term target of 25%.Gearing, of course, depends on the value of the company’s equity as well as its debt, and that was hit by some painful writedowns, notably $1.65 billion mainly related to U.S. shale gas assets. The company joins an ever-growing list of majors forced to admitted their bet on shale has turned sour:   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX),   BP   (LON:BP) and Equinor (OL:EQNR) have all already taken similar hits, unable to escape the glut caused by associated gas coming out of new oil fields in the Permian and other shale basins.Other impairments, notably in Australia and Singapore, took the total value of writedowns in the quarter to $2.94 billion, although the company was also able to soften the blow by booking some non-cash gains on derivatives and deferred tax positions.It would be nice to think that Shell (LON:RDSa) will be able to move on after putting the writedowns behind it. Unfortunately, that looks like wishful thinking. Margins in refining and marketing, and in chemicals, all weakened against a backdrop of soft Chinese demand in the fourth quarter, and the increasingly obvious impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy leaves little scope for an improvement any time soon.The risk is that the coronavirus, having infected the Chinese economy, will force Shell (LON:RDSa) to choose between higher leverage or suspending buybacks altogether. In an extreme case, it may even be forced to resort to a scrip dividend again to avoid any further rise in debt levels, a tactic it last used to keep shareholders happy for a couple of years after the BG Group acquisition. The only safe bet would seem to be that the dividend -- one of the most important for European pension funds -- will continue to be paid at its current level in one form or another. At a yield of 6.86%, that is no small consolation to long-term investors.Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday that the company’s intentions to complete the $25 billion program remains unchanged. But that language is intentionally and justifiably vague. With Brent now trading below $60 a barrel and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies seemingly not in any hurry to make any further cuts to their own production, to promise anything more would be folly.",0,0

"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s a miserable, manic Monday for airline stocks across Europe thanks to a triple-whammy of bad news from France, Germany and the U.K.The biggest loser in early trading was Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), which fell as much as 8.4% after a report that it will step in to rescue the bankrupt Aigle Azur airline. EasyJet (LON:EZJ), which was also linked with making a bid for Aigle Azur, fell 3.2%.The news threatens a rerun – albeit on a smaller scale – of the Air Berlin fiasco two years ago, when Europe’s airlines passed up a golden opportunity to resolve problems of overcapacity in the short-haul segment, and instead carved up the collapsed operator's assets between themselves in an attempt to grab market share.As with the Air Berlin episode, there is the suspicion that the government will lean on the local national champion (then, Berlin and Lufthansa; now Paris and Air France-KLM) to come up with some of solution that minimizes job losses.The timing of the report is unfortunate, in any case. Air France-KLM published disappointing traffic figures for August earlier, showing the economic slowdown taking a heavy toll on its business.The number of the passengers carried by the Franco-Dutch group rose by only 1% from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year, they’d been up 3.2%. Passenger growth is no longer keeping up with AF-KLM’s capacity growth: available seat-kilometers were up 1.6%. In other words, the group is flying more empty seats across the world – so, not the best time to be buying more uneconomic capacity, one might think.Reminders of the sector’s recurring problems with overreaching were enough to push Ryanair (LON:RYA), Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) down by more than 2% each.Germany’s Lufthansa was a relative outperformer, losing only 1.9%. That’s despite comments by the head of Germany’s Christian Democrats on Sunday that she supported a new tax on flights in order to reduce carbon emissions. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview with state broadcaster ARD that a levy on flights could be “one way” forward, along with cutting value-added tax on less carbon-intensive rail transport. France already introduced a carbon-related tax on flights earlier this summer, and a rapprochement of policy between the EU’s two biggest countries could pave the way for a pan-European initiative to limit emissions from one sector where they are still growing rapidly.The third part of the triple-whammy Monday affected only one company: International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) fell 1.8% as British Airways pilots began their biggest strike in over 40 years, in search of higher pay and better working conditions. That news had, however, been mostly priced in.Elsewhere, Europe’s markets were mixed, with the benchmark STOXX 600 practically unchanged at 387.24. Italy's FTSE MIB led gains, up 0.3% to its highest level since late July. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1% along with the French CAC 40, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.2%. ",0,0
"(Reuters) - European shares dropped broadly on Thursday as investors shunned risky assets while waiting to see whether United States and China manage to avoid a trade war which would damage the global economy.The pan-European STOXX 600 index had dropped 0.7 percent by 0720 GMT, touching a fresh four-week low.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that China ""broke the deal"" it had reached in trade talks with the United States, and vowed not to back down on imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports.As the world's largest economies resume two-day trade talks on Thursday in Washington, investors were on the edge to see if a last minute truce could avert a sharp increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday.More than seven major sectors lost above 1 percent. Tariff-exposed auto stocks slid 1.6 percent decline while semiconductor stocks also lost ground.Adding to chipmaker's woes was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Corp's uninspiring full year outlook.Losses in heavyweight bank stocks weighed the most, with results from some of the biggest Italian banks in focus.Italy's third largest lender, Banco BPM dropped nearly 6 percent after reporting a halving of loan-loss provisions for the first quarter.Meanwhile, the country's biggest bank by assets UniCredit dipped even after it reiterated its 2019 targets and posted a net profit above analyst expectations.Among the biggest decliners were shares of ArcelorMittal after the world's largest steelmaker cut demand forecast for its key markets and said it was facing the twin challenges of lower steel prices and reduced consumption in Europe.German wholesaler Metro slid after reporting another quarter of falling sales at its Russian business and its Real hypermarkets, which the company is in the process of selling. Swiss drugmaker Novartis dipped on a deal to buy Takeda Pharmaceutical's eye drug assets for $3.4 billion.Shares of Norway's Equinor came under pressure after wage talks between Norwegian oil firms and their employees broke down.Investors sought safety in defensive stocks such as telecom, utilities and real estate which eked out the smallest losses.Germany's Rheinmetall was the top percentage gainer on the STOXX 600 after it confirmed its outlook and reported a rise in revenue in the first quarter, mainly driven by its booming defense unit.

Whales’ Really Are Behind The Big Moves in Bitcoin, Research FindsA sea of red washed over bitcoin Friday, sending some into a frenzied search for fundamental reasons for the move. More often than not, a clear reason for price swings has been found to be lacking, leading many to lay the blame at the feet of traders with sizable bitcoin holdings, bitcoin whales, able to move prices in a single swoop.But the role that the whales play in the crypto market may have been underestimated.New findings suggest that a single trader was responsible for the surge in bitcoin to nearly $20,000 two years ago.Finance professors John Griffin and Amin Shams at the University of Texas and Ohio State University claimed that bitcoin’s value between March 2017 and March 2018 was manipulated through large-volume trades.""This one large player or entity either exhibited clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large price impact on bitcoin that is not observed in aggregate flows from other smaller traders,"" they wrote in a paper, which was shared with Bloomberg ahead of its publication in the Journal of Finance.But the professors are not the only ones shinning a light on the whales’ manipulation.Whale Alert, a site that keeps tables on moves in wallets for cryptocurrencies worth more than $50 million, identified a high number of high-value transactions that could explain the 20% downturn in bitcoin between October 21 and October 22.Underscoring the impact of whales on the price of bitcoin, Whale Alert co-founder and CEO Frank van Weert highlighted an address, inactive since 2011 and boasting 80,000 in bitcoin, that could “crush the market completely” if they decide to sell.Against the backdrop of overburdening pressure by the whales, some have suggested that an influx of new investors is needed to level the playing field.Institutional investors have been long courted by crypto markets, with many believing that Wall Street’s participation is needed for the next major rally.Products like bitcoin futures were launched to make crypto accessible to Wall Street.But that has brought in another class of whales, who reportedly were responsible for the reverse in bitcoin from its all-time high.A letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released in last year in May, suggested the slump in bitcoin from near $20,000 was largely driven by institutional investors following the launch of bitcoin futures.“The advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the San Francisco Fed said.3.

"By Nick Carey and Joseph WhiteDECATUR, Texas/FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Mickey McMaster is on his 12th pickup truck. The 61-year old farm equipment dealer in Decatur, Texas, two weeks ago treated himself to a 2019 GMC Denali for around $69,000 - a reward for long hours at work.“For me this is the Cadillac of trucks, it’s a real luxury vehicle,"" McMaster said. ""I’ve worked my way up to afford a truck like this and it shows that I’ve earned it.”  McMaster is the kind of customer General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is banking on as it plans to add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan that will build a new generation of its largest pickups. Demand from Texas and other heartland states for big pick-ups is providing a lifeline to many workers the No. 1 U.S. automaker is laying off at plants elsewhere. The Detroit Three automakers and thousands of their U.S. workers are counting on customers like McMaster to keep buying bigger and more luxurious pickup trucks even if overall U.S. vehicle demand weakens this year, as most analysts predict.At Flint, GM will build a new generation of its heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierras, including luxury models that are some of the most profitable vehicles on the planet. GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Ram division own the segment and are each doubling down with new or redesigned models launching this year. Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000. GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy-duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, that is now building all such trucks for the company. At the same time that GM is laying off thousands of U.S. workers and planning to shutter five North American factories, Flint is hiring. The plant runs on three daily shifts, six days a week. As the new model’s assembly system ramps up, the plant’s capacity will increase by more than 25 percent, plant manager Mike Perez told Reuters. The Flint plant plans to add 1,000 workers, more than half of the 1,500 factory workers who have asked to transfer from plants GM has targeted for shutdown as part of CEO Mary Barra's restructuring plan.“We’re bringing in 50 to 100 people every week,” said Perez.Workers last week were still finishing the job of retooling the Flint factory to build the new heavy-duty trucks as part of a $1.5 billion investment project. A highlight of the new assembly line: two-story tall Fanuc robots hoist a cab and a bed for a truck from separate pallets, swing them in opposing arcs, then gently lower them onto a truck frame to be bolted together by different robots. Detroit Three executives boast that the heavy-duty pickup market is protected by ""moats"" - a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks and decades of engineering that have yielded vehicles that haul 30,000 pound trailers, ride like large luxury sedans, and offer the same safety and connectivity technology as a BMW or Lexus luxury car.Pickup trucks account for three-quarters of the 235 or so new vehicles Carey “CW” Williams (NYSE:WMB) sells each month at his Decatur dealership. And nearly half of those are higher-end, luxury models that can sell for $70,000 or more.Williams said he is not concerned about the new Ram trucks as competition for GM. “Pickup trucks are our bread and butter, and we’ve got the new model to prove it with all the bells and whistles customers want,” he said.Mark Ary, 37, a second-generation owner of an HVAC installation/repair business, paid $65,000 for a white 2019 Silverado High Country. He liked the air conditioning for the truck's rear seats, its 360-degree cameras, and hands-free technology that allows him to call and text. “GM really stepped it up with the technology for the 2019 truck,” Ary said.'MASSIVE' TRUCKSFord, the leader in the heavy-duty pickup segment, will launch later this year versions of its F-series Super Duty pickups with a 7.3 liter gasoline engine - more than three times the displacement of the power-plant in a typical Ford Fusion sedan. Fiat Chrysler's Ram brand is revving up a redesigned lineup of heavy-duty pickups offering optional 12-inch display screens and a 6.7 liter  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI) diesel engine that delivers 1,000 pound-feet of torque - enough to haul a 35,000 pound trailer. GM's Silverado and GMC heavy-duty trucks will offer new diesel engines, 10-speed transmissions and trailer-towing capability “well in excess of 30,000 pounds,” said Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM's large pickup and SUV programs.The new Chevrolet and GMC trucks coming down the Flint assembly line stand out from older models on the same line. They are taller and have more imposing hoods and grilles than the older trucks.“We wanted the truck to look massive,” Herrick said. HEAVY-DUTY INVESTMENTDetroit automakers are investing heavily to expand their profitable heavy pickup franchises beyond commercial and work customers. Each has luxury heavy-duty pickup models, such as Ram's Laramie Longhorn, Ford's Limited and Chevrolet's High Country. GM has developed a multi-model luxury truck sub-brand, GMC Denali. Now, 60 percent of GMC heavy-duty pickups sold wear the Denali badge, GMC global brand chief Duncan Aldred told Reuters. With a diesel engine, sticker prices top $70,000.Heavy-duty pickups are not subject to the same federal fuel economy rules as lighter trucks and sedans. They fall under less stringent standards applied to commercial trucks, where a vehicle's capacity for work allows for more fuel consumption. These pickups do not have mileage estimates on their price stickers as lighter trucks do.The growing sales of heavy-duty pickups and their evolution toward luxury, personal use vehicles is drawing criticism from advocates of curbing carbon dioxide emissions. ""With a 7.3-liter engine, Ford's new massive pickup deserves to be launched as the Ford Valdez,"" Dan Becker, director of the Center for Auto Safety's Safe Climate Campaign, wrote in an email. In Flint, the assignment to build GM's new heavy duty trucks is a lifeline for workers like Randy Randall, a 41-year GM veteran who said he has worked at several GM plants, moving when layoffs hit. Now, he checks trucks at the end of the Flint assembly line.Randall smiled as a screen in front of his GMC truck flashed a message that it had passed the tests. “It’s got a great future,” he said.

"(Bloomberg) --  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc said it’s under investigation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for possible corrupt practices, the latest legal headache for the world’s biggest commodity trader.The probe comes after the London-listed company was subpoenaed last year by the U.S. Justice department for documents relating to its dealings in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela since 2007.Glencore said Thursday that the CFTC had notified it of investigations into whether the company and its subsidiaries ""may have violated certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and/or CFTC Regulations through corrupt practices in connection with commodities.""The company said it believes the CFTC’s investigations ""have a similar scope in terms of subject matter"" to the DOJ probe, which became public last July.The commodity trading industry is facing a multitude of bribery and corruption investigations in jurisdictions ranging from Brazil to the U.S., drawing comparisons with the early 1980s when Glencore’s founder Marc Rich was prosecuted for tax evasion.The director of enforcement at the CFTC said last month in a speech that the agency was investigating overseas fraud and manipulation under the Commodities Exchange Act.""Companies and individuals engaging in foreign corrupt practices should recognize that this sort of misconduct might constitute fraud, manipulation, false reporting, or a number of other types of violations under the CEA, and thus be subject to enforcement actions brought by the CFTC,"" James McDonald said in New Orleans.Glencore’s shares have declined about 8 percent since the DOJ started is investigation last year, even as most miners gained.

"(Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on Thursday while the dollar took a back seat as Joe Biden inched towards taking the White House following victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, although the Democrats looked unlikely to secure a Senate majority.Markets were trying to gauge the fallout from a splitgovernment, and expectations rose that a policy gridlock thatwould prevent greater regulation and limit fiscal stimulus couldalso force the hand of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Each of Wall Street's three major indexes were higher for a fourth straight day on Thursday while stocks in Europe followed Asian bourses to clock healthy gains. Meanwhile, longer-dated U.S. Treasuries ticked lower after Wednesday's huge gains and U.S. jobless claims data, pushing yields up modestly.COMMENTS:JEREMY SCHWARTZ, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH AT WISDOM TREE""If the Republicans keep the Senate it doesn't matter who is president.The market was expecting a very strong fiscal impulse, offset by higher taxes and that might have led to selling by some people. But as that has come off, tech (sector) has really run. There is an expectation that Biden will have a collaborative tone with (senate majority leader Mitch) McConnell, coming to an agreement about passing some stimulus and taking tax hikes off the table.So you keep the positive of low tax rates and a collaborative spirit which could bring some stimulus.Markets will look past some of developments such as Trump contesting the election results, as long as there are no other ramifications such as social unrest that spirals out of control.""JOHN PETRIDES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TOCQUEVILLE ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK""Nothing is set on stone yet but the market is getting what it wanted and that is Republicans holding the Senate and a Biden victory. That was one of the best case scenarios that the market was looking for.""By having the Republicans in the Senate, even though we don't know who the president is, it basically enforces that if Biden is elected president, he'll have a harder time passing through his tax plan which was to raise corporate. """"Now investors just need to set their expectations that it could be still several more days if not longer until we know who the official president is. If Biden does squeak out in some of these states, president Trump already has an army of attorneys to fight the process. Presumably if it were to flip and Trump were to pull it out, Biden would do the same and contest the result.We need to be patient here to see who will be President but if Republicans were to win the Senate, that I think that is key and that's why the markets are responding so positively.""PAUL EITELMAN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, SEATTLE""A protracted period with no known result could inject volatility into financial markets. What we do know is that the U.S. and global economy are both still in the early innings of a new cyclical expansion. Politics offers plenty of surprises, but there are some very powerful economic forces already at work that don’t care at all about who is in the White House.""FRANCESCA FORNASARI, HEAD OF CURRENCY SOLUTIONS, INSIGHT INVESTMENT, LONDON""The market is still trying to get its head around the what this result means and the uncertainty is likely to continue until we know who will be the next President. If any contesting is limited to recounting votes, we would expect the impact to be short lived; but if it becomes longer-lasting and adversarial by going through the Courts, then I suspect that will have longer term repercussions and safe haven currencies will outperform vs the US dollar.""ROBERT WOLF, FOUNDER, 32 ADVISORS, NEW YORK, NY""A split election with a Biden Presidency along with a GOP led Senate will lead to growth oriented stimulus such as infrastructure but without the likelihood of overly burdensome regulations nor big tax reform legislation being passed. It will also bring on a less volatile and much welcomed environment bringing the end to a White House governing by Twitter.""NOEL DIXON, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, BOSTON, MA""As the market sees it gridlock equals the opportunity to still pursue stimulus but constrain Biden from any major progressive impulses - higher taxes, higher regulation. The tones coming from McConell will be critical once the dust settles and Biden remains on top""FRÉDÉRIQUE CARRIER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT""While the equity market typically prefers gridlock, this isn’t always the case. Market participants have been clamoring for another large COVID-19 fiscal stimulus package, and have also begun to get their hopes up for an infrastructure spending package. These bills would probably be more modest in size and scope with a divided Congress. Fiscal stimulus could be delayed until after the inauguration, and an infrastructure package is no guarantee.""""But we think gridlock would be perceived positively for certain sectors. For example, it would mean that far-reaching fossil fuel, health care, and financial industry regulations would be much less likely. We also doubt the Tech and Communication Services sectors at large would face serious regulatory challenges, although select companies could continue to face scrutiny in the near term.""PETER LEGER, GLOBAL FRONTIERS PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CORONATION FUND MANAGERS, SOUTH AFRICA""A Democrat win in the U.S. does not mean a stronger dollar, so currencies around the world get a break and we see the dollar weaken and you have currencies strengthening in a number of other markets, so from a returns perspective it's very supportive for emerging markets.""The trade hostility we started seeing reduces, which is beneficial to any open global economies.""JUSTIN ONUEKWUSI, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, LEGAL & GENERALINVESTMENT MANAGERS, LONDON""The Fed today is a bit of a sideshow, but there is a chanceit may strengthen forward guidance around potential QE, and thatwould be dollar-negative as you may also have less fiscalstimulus coming. Another thing that makes us medium-termnegative on the dollar is whether you see a weaker United statesfrom a political perspective going forward. If (post-electionwrangling) goes on for weeks or months, with Republicansrefusing to accept the results, that's not positive from apolitical perspective.""DIDIER SAINT-GEORGES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CARMIGNAC, PARIS ""There is a lot of position-squaring going on and we shouldnot fall into the mistake of reasoning out moves every hour.Things like green energy are long-term trends which willcontinue.""""Compared to what was anticipated, some (Treasury yield)curve flattening may make sense, but even if some ratespositions were unwound, we should not get carried away trying tosee a reversal. One takeaway is that regulatory risk to thepharma sector has reduced.

The push for him to increaseanti-trust measures is limited and that's perhaps why we'reseeing the Nasdaq rise.""SIMON CARLTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARLTON JAMES GROUP,LONDON""If you look at the numbers, trends, previous cycles,unemployment numbers -- a double-dip recession is coming, and Idon't think either president, whoever gets in, is going to stopthat.

"It's official. David Solomon will succeed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Wall Street firm's new CEO. The firm made the announcement on Tuesday, saying Solomon will become CEO and join the board on Oct. 1. Solomon's ascension to CEO was largely expected after he was named in March as the sole president of Goldman,  following the departure of his co-president Harvey Schwartz. With the formal announcement, Solomon can now begin to make changes to his leadership team.Blankfein will remain chairman through the end of the year, and then take the title of senior chairman after his retirement. “David is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,"" Blankfein said in the firm's statement. ""He has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy.""Blankfein, who once joked that he would die at his desk, was the longest-serving Wall Street CEO after JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon. Taking the reigns of Goldman in 2006, Blankfein, a former gold salesman, navigated the firm through the financial crisis and the subsequent fallout in which the firm was demonized  and called the ""vampire squid"" of finance.He later helped improve Goldman's public image, serving as an elder statesman of sorts for the industry. Under Blankfein, Goldman has expanded away from its roots as a pure investment bank and  into new areas such as its consumer banking business, Marcus. Raised in a housing project in Brooklyn’s East New York neighborhood, he attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School through financial aid. Solomon cut his teeth as a banker at Bear Stearns before joining Goldman as a partner in 1999. He ran the bank's leveraged finance unit and rose up the ranks of the the investment banking business  with a reputation for being Goldman's point man on many key client relationships, including those with 3M, Disney's Bob Iger, and the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.He's also known for his work to address gender imbalance within Goldman's workforce, and for spearheading a task force to try and retain junior bankers. Solomon is also known for his unorthodox hobby: production of electronic dance music. Solomon, known as DJ D-Sol, recently released his first track, a dance remix of Fleetwood Mac's 1977 hit ""Don't Stop.""",1,2
"PARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is unlikely to name a new leadership team before the end of August or early September, sources close to the matter told Reuters.The airline has been hunting for a new boss to fill a gap left by the abrupt departure of chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac in May, after staff rejected a pay proposal aimed at ending strikes that have resulted in heavy losses.Air France KLM reported its second quarter results on Wednesday but did not give clues on the CEO search.""The initial timetable was - 'Let's strive for an announcement before end-July.' It was the will of the nomination committee to identify a candidate before the end of the month,"" said one of the sources.But disturbances ranging from media speculation about the potential candidates to AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) voicing an interest in buying a stake in Air France KLM and then dropping that plan, had complicated the process, said the sources.""So you lose a week here and there and it's August 1. It means nothing will happen before the end of the month. Everyone must go and come back from holidays,"" said one of the sources.In mid-July, Anne-Marie Couderc - the interim chairman of Air France KLM - had said in a memorandum seen by Reuters that the company hoped to have a new leadership team fully up and running by September.According to La Tribune.fr website, Air France-KLM's nomination committee is currently talking to one north American executive with a good knowledge of the airlines industry.Air France-KLM declined to comment on the situation.The French government has a stake of about 14 percent in Air France-KLM, while Delta Airlines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) each hold 8.8 percent.

"By Manas Mishra(Reuters) - Two major shareholder advisory firms urged investors to vote against billionaire investor David Tepper's hedge fund demand that Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc immediately split the roles of chief executive officer and chairman, in a boost to the Botox maker.The recommendation from Institutional Shareholder Services LP and Glass Lewis & Co against the proposal of Tepper's Appaloosa gives firepower to Allergan Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders ahead of the drugmaker's shareholder meeting on May 1.""Their recommendations affirm our position that our plan to adopt separate Chair and CEO positions with the next leadership transition is the best approach for Allergan shareholders,"" Allergan said in a statement.However, an analyst said the recommendations were contrary to the views of many investors.""This news is likely to frustrate a sizeable group of shareholders and we continue to await the result of the vote,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said. Appaloosa has been pressing Allergan since last year to separate the two roles, and asked for an immediate split after Allergan said an independent member of its board would be chairman, but only at its next leadership change. Both the proxy firms said that an immediate separation of the roles was not necessary.""There are no significant concerns regarding the board's current leadership structure sufficient to suggest that an immediate split of the CEO and chairman roles is warranted at this time rather than at the next CEO transition,"" ISS was quoted as saying in the Allergan statement.Appaloosa said ISS' recommendations were ""baffling"" as they were inconsistent with the firm's support for a similar proposal last year, and asked shareholders to vote for its proposal.Allergan, under pressure to rescue the company's falling stock prices, launched a review of its strategy last year. But that review is likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit.Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review, and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of its depression treatment rapastinel.Allergan's shares have fallen about 12 percent in the past 12 months. They trade nearly 60 percent below their record high of $340.33 in 2015. ",1,2
"(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S has named Chris Vogelzang as its chief executive officer, ending months of speculation over who will steer Denmark’s biggest bank through the continuing fallout of its money-laundering scandal.The 56-year-old Dutchman and ABN Amro Group N.V. veteran will start June 1. He replaces Jesper Nielsen, who has been running Danske on an interim basis since October, when Danske’s dirty-money saga ended the career of Thomas Borgen.Russell Quelch, an equity specialist at Redburn in London, said that “the market will welcome the fact that it’s an external candidate. The bank needs to start afresh, post the money laundering saga.”Shares in Danske rose almost 3% after trading started in Copenhagen.Vogelzang “brings many years of management experience from the financial sector,” Danske said, including a stint from 2000 to 2017 at ABN Amro, the last eight years of which were as a member of its management board and head of its global retail and private banking activities.Danske has purged large chunks of its upper ranks after last year taking center stage in what may be Europe’s worst ever dirty money scandal. Denmark’s biggest bank revealed in a September report that a “large part” of around $230 billion that flowed through a non-resident Estonian unit over a nine-year period was suspicious.The saga wiped out almost half the bank’s market value last year, and triggered criminal investigations in the U.S. and across Europe. Borgen, who was ousted in October, had previously been in charge of Danske’s Baltic operations. Shortly after he left, Danske’s biggest shareholder got rid of the chairman, Ole Andersen.Danske had tried to replace Borgen earlier, but failed to get its initial candidate approved. The Financial Supervisory Authority rejected a proposal to have the bank run by Jacob Aarup-Andersen, a 41-year-old who runs Danske’s wealth business and who used to be the chief financial officer, citing his lack of relevant experience.Quelch at Redburn said he has questions about the choice of CEO. “The fact is that he has no previous CEO experience and turning Danske around isn’t going to be a simple task,” he said. “So in my view, the appointment is a tick-box exercise -- getting someone in the seat so that the group can start to move forward with the new strategy. But I don’t think he’s going to excite investors in terms of his experience. He obviously does have experience, but not CEO experience.”Vogelzang was once a candidate to become CEO at ABN Amro, to succeed Gerrit Zalm in 2017, who joined Danske’s board in March. But the Dutch state, which is a majority shareholder, and the supervisory board blocked the move. Not long after that, ABN cut several management jobs and Vogelzang left.Danske faces years of investigations as prosecutors across multiple jurisdictions sift through the evidence. Investors are hoping that having a new CEO will allow Danske to focus on its business amid fears that the scandal is driving away clients and investors.“Despite its current challenges, Danske Bank has all the prerequisites to continue to be a strong and competitive bank that creates value for all its stakeholders,” Vogelzang said in the statement.Borgen, 55, is reportedly among 10 former Danske bankers to have been met with preliminary charges as the laundering investigation continues. The development comes as Denmark takes several steps to tighten its anti-money laundering laws, including the possibility of prison sentences and considerably tougher fines.(Adds background on Vogelzang.)",1,2

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG has financial firepower for acquisitions even with net debt of $26 billion, though the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to value takeover candidates, Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said in an interview. ""We generate a high free cash flow that allows us to not only finance our dividend but to direct capital to other purposes,"" Narasimhan told the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.Still, ""acquisitions have slowed recently from a structural perspective"" during the pandemic, he said. Narasimhan, a U.S. citizen who took over two years ago as CEO, acknowledged disappointment that Novartis' existing medicines had not proven more useful against COVID-19. For instance, the company, like others, abandoned a trial of its older malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine after it failed to help patients in scientific studies.Moreover, he said Novartis had hoped to be faster in developing new drugs against COVID-19 and could have potentially profited from more cooperation with smaller biotech companies. ""We concentrated more on our own in-house activities - and learned a lesson from it,"" he said.Many of the medicines that Novartis is supplying for patients stricken with COVID-19 come from its Sandoz generics unit. For now, Narasimhan said Novartis is not interested in selling Sandoz, but rather continuing work to boost its sales and profit margins squeezed by U.S. price pressure.""We believe at this time that we can do this best with Sandoz within the Novartis group,"" he told the newspaper.Novartis' share price has fallen 15% this year, compared to peer Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF)'s 2% rise.Beyond recent legal settlements in corruption cases that topped $1 billion, Narasimhan believes safety problems that emerged with new eye medicine Beovu have cost Novartis shares 10% of their value.""Challenge No. 1 was Beovu's launch,"" he said.

The company, launched by U.S. lifestyle blogger Emily Weiss in 2014, has grown to over 200 employees and last year doubled its online sales to $100 million.Glossier was valued at $390 million after a $52 million funding round one year ago, according to PitchBook Data.With nearly 2 million Instagram followers, the brand has grabbed eyeballs with ads that feature everyday people, products that cater to a variety of skin tones and emphasize a natural, ""no-makeup"" look.The company earlier this month launched ""Play,"" a brand that sells more colorful, flashier makeup, as part of efforts to expand its customer base.Kylie Cosmetics, Pat McGrath Labs, Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Huda Beauty are some other brands with a valuation nearing or above $1 billion, according to media reports.Glossier on Tuesday also said it had hired Vanessa Wittman, a former finance executive at Dropbox and Yahoo-owner Oath Inc, as its new chief financial officer.

"By Lefteris KaragiannopoulosOSLO (Reuters) - The liquidity of Britain's short-term power markets is likely to fall by 10-20% if the country leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of October, a senior executive at the EPEX SPOT power exchange told Reuters.Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. If it does so without a deal, it would no longer be coupled to European power markets. In the case of a deal, however, cross-border trading will not be affected during a transition period agreed with the EU.The intraday and day-ahead markets are among the most liquid products of a power exchange. They represent power that is traded for use within the same day and electricity for physical delivery the following day.The high liquidity means that any loss of transaction volumes would hit profit at the power exchanges.""For our traders, it is clearly a disadvantage ... (A no-deal Brexit) is likely to have an effect on the liquidity of the market, particularly on the day-ahead time frame,"" said EPEX SPOT's director for public and regulatory affairs, Wolfram Vogel.Market liquidity would fall by 10-20% for intraday and day-ahead power trading combined, Vogel said without elaborating on how long it would take for the market to recover.EPEX did not have a detailed plan to compensate for any lost liquidity, a spokeswoman said.Cross-border day-ahead transactions in their current form will stop, added Vogel, and EPEX SPOT would instead organize local day-ahead auctions in Britain.Trading within-day electricity with Ireland, however, would remain unaffected, he said.EPEX SPOT is working on expanding in the Nordics and Vogel said the exchange's within-day and day-ahead operations in the region are likely to begin between November and January.A Norwegian license to operate day-ahead power trading is still pending, he said, together with more technical details that need to be finalised with the Nordic transmission system operators.EPEX SPOT is in contact with members that already trade in the Nordics, Vogel added, and its sales team is working on adding new customers, offering participation fee discounts.EPEX's parent, EEX, is Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) flagship power derivatives market. EEX already trades financial power derivative contracts in the Nordics, competing with Nasdaq (O:NDAQ) in the futures market.The start of operations in the Nordics will mean the end of Nord Pool's local monopoly in intraday and day-ahead trading.",1,2

"By John McCrankNEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange is taking steps to separate traders on the floor of its iconic 11 Wall Street building and employees of the NYSE and its parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday.The steps, which include mandating separate entrances and eating spaces for floor traders and staff, are aimed at reducing the likelihood that an event in the building's office tower will impact operations on the trading floor, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund, said in the memo, seen by Reuters.Non-working visitors to the NYSE floor have been kept to a minimum this week, the building has intensified overnight cleaning efforts, and an outside vendor will provide extra deep cleaning on weekends, it said.""Given the critical work by our NYSE and NYSE American floor communities to underpin the orderly function of global markets, all of these efforts, and others, will remain ongoing until further notice,"" the memo said.Concerns about how the fast-spreading coronavirus will affect the economy have led to global stock market routs, with volumes and volatility spiking to levels not seen since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.While nearly all U.S. stock trading is done electronically, the NYSE says its hybrid electronic and floor broker model helps keep trading more orderly.But even the Big Board can operate fully electronically if the floor needs to be shut. The NYSE and exchange operators Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE), and IEX Group have all said they have regularly tested contingency plans in place to ensure continuous trading if the coronavirus leads to some facilities being temporarily shuttered.To reduce the chance of that happening, only NYSE and ICE staff who work in the 11 Wall Street's office tower will be able to eat in the NYSE cafeteria, the memo said. Those who work on the floor will have access to a special food service from NYSE's Trading Floor Coffee Kiosk.A restaurant on the exchange's 7th floor named 1792, after the year the NYSE was founded under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street, will be temporarily closed.",1,2

"By Nivedita Balu and Jaslein Mahil(Reuters) -  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) replaced its chief executive officer and chairman on Monday, days after the cosmetics giant rattled investors by warning that fiscal-year performance could be hurt by supply chain issues.The company said retail industry veteran Pierre Laubies would replace Camillo Pane as its chief executive officer, its fourth CEO in as many years.Coty Chairman Bart Becht is also ceding the role to fellow director Peter Harf, but will stay on the board.The new executives are associated with JAB Holding Co, a consumer goods to coffee conglomerate that is the private investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. Both Harf and Becht run JAB, which has a 39 percent stake in Coty and is also a majority shareholder of Dutch beverage company Jacobs Douwe Egberts, where Laubies was the CEO until December 2017.The management shakeup comes as Coty struggles to integrate the 41 beauty brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble (N:PG) in 2016. Last week, the company said supply chain problems from a trucker strike in Brazil, hurricanes in the United States and a warehousing issue in Germany were making it difficult to integrate the brands quickly. It also issued a profit warning that wiped out more than a fifth of its market value. ""(The changes are) not that surprising given the poor performance of the company and the additional supply chain issues that have come about,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser.Becht had handpicked Pane as Coty's CEO in 2016, but shares have fallen 64 percent since his appointment. Both executives previously worked at  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), where Becht once served as CEO.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said the degree of senior level leadership changes at Coty over the last two years has been overwhelming. Coty's new CEO Laubies is likely to face challenges that were similar to those at JDE, which he led for more than four years and was responsible for overhauling a mass coffee brand in a highly competitive market, said Jonathan Feeney, managing partner at research firm Consumer Edge.""Certainly some of the challenges of the COTY Consumer Beauty business rhyme with those of JDE,"" Feeney said.Laubies has also worked at confectionary company Mars Inc and soup maker  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB). Coty shares were up nearly 4 percent on Monday afternoon. ",0,0
"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s asset-management unit, which oversees $250 billion for insurers, said an economic slowdown in the U.S. is the biggest investment risk for the industry for the first time since the financial crisis.“Insurers expressed a growing consensus that we are in the late stage of the U.S. credit cycle,” the Goldman unit said in a report following a survey of 300 senior insurance executives. “With rates expected to rise and equity valuations high, insurers are concerned with achieving adequate returns without leaving their portfolios exposed in the event of a downturn.”Inflation expectations have also risen in the U.S. as rising protectionism damps prospects for global growth, adding to the concerns about the economy. That could be a double whammy for insurers, cutting the value of their portfolios in the short term and probably increasing the claims paid by non-life insurers over the long term.In 2017, “people were expecting inflation to become an issue in five years,” Etienne Comon head of insurance in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said at a media briefing. ""Now this has been brought forward -- more view inflation becoming an issue within the next two to three years.”Executives plan to cut risk in equities and credit, increase liquidity in their portfolios and reduce the duration of their exposures as interest rates rise, the survey shows. High-yield debt, tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. equities are among the investments that managers plan to decrease. Infrastructure debt, commercial mortgage loans and corporate credit for mid-market firms are areas where they want to allocate more capital.Cryptocurrencies, while being much debated, are not believed to be suitable investments for portfolios at this stage, while a third of those surveyed view them as a potential risk to financial markets.",1,2

"By Vibhuti Sharma(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) is raising monthly fees for its U.S. subscribers by between 13 percent and 18 percent, the video streaming pioneer's first price increase since 2017 as it spends heavily on original content and international expansion.Prices for its popular standard plan, which allows streaming on two devices at the same time, will rise to $12.99 per month from $10.99, the company said in a statement.Netflix shares rose 6.5 percent to close at $354.64, adding to their 30 percent rise so far this year.The company's top-tier plan, which allows streaming on four screens in high definition, will increase to $15.99 from $13.99 per month, while the fee for its basic plan will rise to $8.99 from $7.99.In comparison, AT&T Inc's (N:T) HBO Now streaming service charges $14.99 per month, while Hulu's no-advertisements plan is priced at $11.99 per month.""It highlights that Netflix has pricing power and even after the increase it remains a very cheap entertainment alternative,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said.Netflix has been spending billions to bolster its original content, which boasts award-winning shows such as ""The Crown,"" ""Black Mirror"" and ""Wild Wild Country"" to fend off intensifying competition from players such as Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) Prime Video service and Hulu. The company reported it had 137 million customers at the end of September.The price hikes are expected to fetch Netflix hundreds of millions of dollars, ahead of the launch of streaming services from AT&T and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS).While aggressive spending - a planned $8 billion in 2018 - has led to a surge in subscriber growth, its debt doubled to $6.50 billion in 2017 from $3.36 billion in 2016.The company is expected to have a debt level of $8.33 billion in 2018, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co, which owns 15,019 shares of Netflix.Netflix is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after market close on Thursday.""With Netflix frequently tapping the debt markets on several recent occasions, the price hike could help ease concerns with a growing deficit on free cash flow to fund a likely continued escalation in Netflix's content spending, which likely topped $13 billion in 2018,"" CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi said.

"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A group of 39 companies, including several of Brazil's largest firms, expressed concerns over deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest on Tuesday, following global investor demands that President Jair Bolsonaro end the destruction or risk divestment.While weaker than the threats from the global investment firms, the joint statement is the first from such a broad and powerful group of Brazilian companies since Bolsonaro became president, and signals that corporate pressure for action is building within the country. The rate of destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest climbed 34% in the first five months of the year from a year ago after hitting an 11-year high in 2019, government data shows. Environmental advocates blame the expanding destruction on Bolsonaro, who has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region while also deploying the military to fight clear cutting and fires.The signatories on the statement include many of Brazil's largest listed companies, such as the bank Itau Unibanco (SA:ITUB4), miner Vale (SA:VALE3), brewer Ambev (SA:ABEV3), and state-owned electric utility Eletrobras (SA:ELET6). Regional or Brazil chiefs for international companies also signed on, including oil firm Shell (L:RDSa), Microsoft (O:MSFT), agrochemical maker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and commodities trader Cargill.Seven major European investment firms controlling more than $2 trillion told Reuters last month they will divest from Brazilian assets if they see no progress on stopping Amazon deforestation.Tuesday's statement did not include an ultimatum, but said the companies were available to work with the government to devise solutions. Strong enforcement of environmental laws is necessary, the companies said.""This group has been increasingly attentive to and concerned about the impact on businesses of the current negative perception of Brazil's image internationally when it comes to the social and environmental issues in the Amazon,"" they said.
