"By Yasin EbrahimInvesting.com - The Dow was flat Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve's pledge to maintain its ultra-easy policy stance and growing expectations for a stimulus deal eased investor jitters on the recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02%, or 7 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.57%.The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged and signaled that near-zero rates would continue through 2023 to support the next phase of the economic recovery as the vaccine rollout gets underway. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the first-quarter data in 2021 will show a significant impact from a surge in the virus, but the economy should perform strongly in the second half of next year, underpinned by a boost from the vaccine rollout. The ongoing pledge from the Fed comes as U.S. lawmakers appear to be closing in on a stimulus deal - expected to include much-needed support for businesses and unemployed Americans – after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said a ""major headway"" had been made in talks.The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 1.1% last month, a deeper contraction than the 0.3% decline expected. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  fell 0.5% confounding expectations for a 0.2% rise. ""COVID and the UI cliff will continue to weigh on spending in December, but we believe Congress is very close to finalizing a new stimulus bill which will reinstate enhanced UI (unemployment insurance) benefits from January through April at $300/week (or $1200/month),"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.Consumer discretionary stocks shrugged off signs of consumer weakness thanks to a rise in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), and Chipotle.Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) rose 5% after Stifel upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from hold, and raised its price target to $1,500 from $1,400.Technology stocks continued their strong start to the week, with  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) among the notable gainers after an upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).JPMorgan upgraded Twitter to overweight from neutral with a $65 price target on expectations for online advertising growth to reaccelerate next year.""We believe Twitter will show the biggest rebound given its sharper pandemic-driven ad decline, along with revenue prioritization throughout the company, early benefits from rebuilt ad tech through the new Ad Server and rollout of Map 2.0, and increases in both advertiser count and ad load,"" JPMorgan said.Energy stocks cut losses as oil prices eased from lows on data showing a larger-than-expected U.S. weekly draw of 3.13 million barrels.In other news, Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) jumped 22%  after agreeing to a tie-up with Aphria (TSX:APHA), creating a combined business valued at about $3.9 billionThe mixed day on Wall Street comes ahead of the Federal Reserve decision in the afternoon and a press conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. ",1,2
"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (O:GOOGL) unit Google has offered concessions for a second time in a bid to address EU antitrust regulators' concerns about its bid for fitness tracker maker Fitbit (N:FIT), a European Commission filing showed on Tuesday.The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 23, did not publish details of the concessions in line with its policy.The EU competition enforcer will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more, or either clear or block the detail.Last month, it rejected Google's pledge not to use the fitness tracker's data for advertising purposes in a bid to address competition concerns, saying that it was insufficient.The Commission recently asked Google rivals and customers about interoperability issues, what technical steps the company could take to foreclose competition to Fitbit to increase its sales, and how incentives could prompt it to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter.It also asked about issues related to digital healthcare and the kind of data Google needs and where they could acquire it, the person said, suggesting concessions may be needed in these two areas.

"By Engen Tham and Scott MurdochSHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Companies across China are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid the central Chinese city of Wuhan amid fears that the new flu-like coronavirus will rapidly spread with much of population embarking on travel for Lunar New Year holidays.Firms from Foxconn (TW:2317) to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) have issued advisories, while the government has urged members of the public to be extra careful if showing symptoms of a fever or a cold and has asked travel and other companies to accommodate people who might be affected.The death toll rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said.At Foxconn's Lunar New Year party on Wednesday, founder Terry Gou advised Taiwan-based employees not to visit mainland China during the week-long holiday period.""Colleagues and their families who have come back from Wuhan are all in isolation at home. The infection is spreading very fast,"" Gou added.Company workers in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, have been wearing facemasks and getting their temperature checked, the Apple (O:AAPL) supplier also said.Huawei Technologies has asked staff to reduce travel to Wuhan and avoid contact with animals, adding that it had set up an outbreak prevention and control team in the city to carry out disinfecting activities, according to an internal note seen by Reuters. Citic  Securities (SS:600030) and investment bank China International Capital Corp (HK:3908) have asked employees to avoid trips to Wuhan and Hubei province, where the city is located, if they can, sources said, adding that if employees did travel there, they were required to report the trip.Citic has also asked staff to voluntarily quarantine themselves if they do travel to Hubei.Huawei and Citic Securities did not respond to requests for comment. A CICC representative declined to comment.HSBC said it had advised employees that travel to Wuhan could continue but has asked them to be extra vigilant.""We have stepped up cleaning measures at all our premises and all employees have been reminded to be more mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,"" a spokeswoman said in an email.Didi Chuxing, China's largest ride-hailing company, said this week it would issue masks and disinfectant to its drivers and would allow passengers and drivers in Wuhan to cancel trips for free in the days up to Jan. 31, adding that the company would bear the costs.Travel booking platforms such as Trip.com (O:TCOM) have said users can cancel travel plans to Wuhan for free, while Shanghai's Disneyland said it will waive rescheduling fees for entry and hotel ticket buyers within six months of the purchase date given that customers might be changing their travel plans.Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said it will allow passengers to Wuhan to change or cancel flights without charge through Feb. 15 and permit cabin crew to wear masks on flights to the mainland.Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) also canceled an annual event in Shenzhen at which founder Pony Ma and other top executives hand employees Lunar New Year red envelopes containing cash.

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) has threatened to close two regional bases and axe up to 120 pilot jobs unless pilots in its home Irish market bypass their union and directly accept a pay cut, a memo seen by Reuters said. Europe's largest low-cost carrier is demanding pay cuts of up to 20% and changes to work practices across Europe.It has said it plans 3,000 job cuts and a reduction in staff unit costs, but faces union resistance in a number of markets. In the memo sent on Friday, Ryanair director of operations Neal McMahon told pilots the union council representing Irish pilots had walked away from talks on Wednesday, something the Forsa trade union denied. McMahon said a union request for an extension of a 30-day consultation on job cuts represented ""stalling tactics"". Instead, the memo sent on the company's internal messaging system, asked pilots to click a button to accept proposals including a 20% pay cut that would be reversed gradually within four years, a spreading of available work via job shares and unpaid leave, and ""productivity improvements"".It said the number of job losses, and whether bases at Cork and Shannon airports remained open would depend on the number of acceptances. A Ryanair spokeswoman said she had ""nothing further to add to that memo"".Trade union Forsa, in a memo to pilots on Friday, said Ryanair's latest proposal was unacceptable as it would effectively leave pilots temporarily on zero-hour contracts and provided no guarantee job losses would be avoided.Forsa said it had requested third-party mediation, but had not received a reply. Ryanair, which is reopening much of its network on July 1, says it needs to cut staff costs to compete with rivals that have received state bailouts.Union representatives have pointed to management comments about expansion opportunities likely to be triggered by the retrenchment of rivals in the wake of COVID-19.

"Investing.com - General Motors (NYSE:GM) burned through $8 billion in cash in the second quarter as Covid-19-driven lockdowns shuttered its factories and crushed its sales. However, the company's net loss of 50c a share was less than a third of what analysts had feared ahead of time, and even the 53% drop in revenue to $16.80 billion was slightly better than forecast. The cash burn, which compared to operating cash flow of $11.9 billion a year earlier, had been the number most eagerly awaited by analysts, and was bang in the middle of the $7 billion to $9 billion range that chief executive Mary Barra had forecast. The company ended the quarter with over $30.6 billion in liquidity at its automaking operations.That ought to reassure the company's investors, who - according to Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar - are focused on one thing only at present: survival.""At this point, all investors want to know whether there is light at the end of the tunnel and whether car producers have enough cash to survive as they manage through the crisis and try to generate sales,"" Anwar said. Anwar added that the company's return from lockdown has been anything but easy, punctuated by ""supply-chain disruptions, temporary shutdowns caused by new positive cases and worker absences.""Sales recovered from a low point of -34% on the year in April to being down only 20% on the year in June, with the Buick Encore and Chevrolet Trailblazer notably picking up market share in the small SUV segment.GM stock rose 3.9% in premarket trading, although it's still down by more than 25% from its February high.General Motors's report follows an earnings beat by Tesla on July 22, who reported EPS of $2.18 on revenue of $6.04B, compared to forecasts EPS of $0 on revenue of $5.15B.Stay up-to-date on all of the upcoming earnings reports by visiting Investing.com's earnings calendar ",1,2

"By April JoynerNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday as quarterly results from banks added to concerns about lower interest rates dampening their profits, while comments from U.S. President Donald Trump on trade also dragged down Wall Street's major indexes.JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) beat quarterly profit estimates but reported weaker net interest income, pointing to rising deposit costs. Those results followed  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) results on Monday, in which the bank reported a drop in its net interest margin.JPMorgan shares erased early losses to end 1.1% higher. Wells Fargo shares, however, slipped 3.0% as the bank tempered its outlook for cutting costs.""The expectation is the yield curve is going to remain flat, so you're going to still continue to see net interest margins compress, and that's going to hurt profitability,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of expected upside to Q3 and Q4.""Stocks also moved lower after Trump said there was a long way to go with China on trade and threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods.The major indexes briefly pared losses after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the U.S. economy humming, but they later moved back to their previous levels.""In a really quiet market, a headline like this has a magnified effect, so even if it's not something investors don't already know, it can move the market with ease,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W.

"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina MandlSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Corruption-ensnared Odebrecht SA has proposed that creditors take over its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, in exchange for reducing Odebrecht's huge debt load, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. The move is the latest sign of the radical way in which Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht, best known for its engineering and construction operations, is remaking itself to renegotiate 70 billion reais in consolidated debt.Accused of bribing politicians and executives to get contracts throughout Latin America, Odebrecht made a deal two years ago with U.S, Brazilian and Swiss authorities, paying a record $3.5 billion in fines to settle charges.Atvos has about 12 billion reais ($3.25 billion) in debt with various lenders, including state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), Caixa Economica Federal and development bank BNDES, as well as private Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11). A debt-for-equity swap would give Atvos more time to recover without selling plants, a potential alternative to paying off debt. Both sources, who requested anonymity because the talks are private, said this week that a sale of Atvos' assets would not be enough to pay off all outstanding debt.The sources added that a final decision has not yet been made regarding a swap and that an agreement to transfer Atvos ownership may not be reached.Atvos is Brazil's second largest ethanol company after Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) and energy firm Cosan (SA:RLOG3).Atvos' net debt is equivalent to about 10 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. By comparison, debt for the sector's best-run companies is double EBITDA or less.In preliminary discussions with creditors, Odebrecht said it wanted lenders to swap most of their debt in Atvos for control of the company, but family-owned company Odebrecht wants to keep a minority stake. The sizes of the stakes have yet to be determined, the sources added. The largest chunk of Atvos debt is held by state-controlled banks, mainly Banco do Brasil and BNDES, one source said. Banco do Brasil, Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter. Odebrecht, Itau and BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The ethanol company has crushing capacity of 37 million tonnes of sugar cane per year, but has been operating at a much lower level due to financial problems. In the 2017/2018 crop, Atvos processed 25.8 million tonnes, according its annual report.Odebrecht hired consultancy Canaplan to assess how much debt Atvos' cash flow could handle, and the firm will present a report to lenders about a new business plan.In November, the corruption-ensnared conglomerate hired advisers to restructure a portion of its bank and bond debt.

"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). gave investors just enough good news Wednesday to let them to breathe a sigh of relief.The shares rallied after the company posted slightly better-than-expected subscriber growth overseas in the third quarter, making up for a far smaller gain at home. Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, helping investors look past a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.After a disappointing quarter three months ago, investors came in with lower expectations this time around. And Netflix cleared that bar, sending the shares up as much as 11% in late trading.“We’re making strides in our key markets and, while we have much more work to do in Asia in the coming years, we are seeing encouraging signs of progress,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.The world’s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.3 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Even though domestic subscriptions missed analysts, they at least rebounded from a decline in the previous quarter. Netflix expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months.International markets account for almost all of Netflix’s growth -- and most of its total customers. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts. A new season of “La Casa de Papel,” a Spanish heist series, boosted interest abroad, especially in Latin America and Europe.“Stranger Things,” meanwhile, was viewed by 64 million people in its first four weeks, the most-watched series to date. The teen science-fiction show, now in its third season, is the service’s biggest hit at home.Netflix expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than analysts expected. While the final three months of the year are typically among the strongest, the company will face new competition from the Disney+ and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ streaming services.Netflix shares rose as high as $318.79 in extended trading. The stock has taken a beating since July, dropping 21% since last quarter’s miss. It closed at $286.28 in regular trading on Wednesday.U.S. WoesThird-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts’ estimates of $1.05.This quarter, the company forecasts profit of 51 cents a share on revenue of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.In the U.S., there wasn’t much to cheer about. The company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year. A recent price increase contributed to the slowdown, Netflix said.The company also is bracing for fresh competition this quarter.“The launch of these new services will be noisy,” Netflix said in its letter. “There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long term, though, we expect we’ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.”(Updates with company remarks starting in third paragraph)",1,2

"LONDON (Reuters) - Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) needs more details on British plans to quarantine travellers before it can assess its impact after seeing strong demand for the routes it has started operating, its chief executive told Reuters.Jozsef Varadi, the chief executive of budget Hungarian carrier Wizz, said on Monday that one option to lower the impact of any quarantine would be to make exemptions for those travellers who had recently tested negative for the virus. Britain has announced a new restriction with a 14-day quarantine requirement on most people arriving into the country by air, saying more details including the timing of the programme would come shortly.Varadi said that it would be logical for the government to allow exemptions to the rule if passengers had had a verified negative test for coronavirus in the days prior to travelling, as happens in other countries where Wizz flies which have quarantine rules.

"By Tim Hepher and William JamesPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's decision to suspend tariffs on Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets and other U.S. goods has stunned the planemaker's European rival Airbus and exposes a growing rift between the UK and Europe over aerospace investment, industry sources and analysts said.Britain said on Tuesday it would suspend the tariffs on Jan. 1, describing the move as an attempt to de-escalate a long-running conflict over aircraft subsidies that has dragged the United States and Europe into a tit-for-tat tariff war.The decision comes amid wider trade talks between Britain and the United States and ends a united front on tariffs between Airbus's political backers Britain, France, Germany and Spain.Airbus played down the move, saying the company's goal remains ""to find a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute to avoid lose-lose tariffs.""Diplomats say U.S. and EU trade chiefs are in ""serious"" negotiations to end the 16-year-old aircraft trade row.Privately, several European trade sources said the surprise UK move risked the most serious cross-Channel split on aerospace in decades. Two of the sources said it was viewed in other capitals as a ""betrayal"" of Airbus, which has 14,000 UK staff.Paul Everitt, head of UK aerospace lobby group ADS, said Britain had acted unilaterally without reciprocal U.S. action.The subsidy dispute is the largest case ever handled by the World Trade Organization and comes to a head just as Britain is leaving the European Union, forcing it to seek new trade deals.""There have always been disagreements, but this is the first time that statecraft has been put so clearly before shareholder trust,"" said a senior UK industry official.Airbus' biggest shareholders include France, Germany and Spain. Britain is not a shareholder but hosts virtually all Airbus wing production and makes its voice heard indirectly.Several sources said the move would reinforce studies by Airbus to re-examine where to build wings for future jets.""It is really damaging and means the UK can forget about further investment,"" the senior industry official said.""SERIOUS"" TALKSThe decision follows a debate about whether Britain can legally impose tariffs inherited from the EU after Jan. 1 because of its technical status in the WTO case. Legal experts have said it could do so under rules of state succession.Britain insisted the move would help resolve the subsidy spat, which has hit other industries forced to pay tariffs.""We are serious about de-escalation ... this (suspension of tariffs) demonstrates the seriousness we place on reaching a negotiated settlement,"" a UK spokesman said on Wednesday.Several sources said an aircraft agreement could be reached before U.S. President Donald Trump leaves office next month.Even though the United States is likely to welcome Britain dropping tariffs, reaching a deal may be complicated by the fact that Airbus jets are built across European borders.""It is not clear how you resolve the UK part without addressing the rest of Europe,"" a U.S. source said. ""The entire discussion has been structured around finding a whole solution"".The U.S. Trade Representative's office declined comment.Airbus has most plants in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. So far jets assembled at a plant in Alabama are exempt from U.S. tariffs, which are due to be reviewed in January.Barring an agreement, one option on the table is to widen the tariffs to cover parts coming from Europe to Alabama, narrowing access to the U.S. market, two sources said. ",1,2
"By Kate DuguidNEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Cetrulo, a former portfolio manager at Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, is raising funds for a global macro discretionary hedge fund and is targeting a launch in the first quarter of 2019, two sources familiar with the situation said.Entheos Capital Advisors formed its limited partnership in recent weeks, and is in early stage negotiations with potential seed and anchor investors, the sources said.The macro fund - so-called because it bets on macroeconomic events across asset classes - will trade foreign exchange, global fixed income, global equity indices and liquid commodities. As a ""discretionary"" fund, it will construct portfolios based on a top-down, thematic view of global markets.Cetrulo will be the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Entheos, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page. After a decade at Point72, he last worked as a global macro portfolio manager at Balyasny Asset Management. The investment team will include people formerly employed by Cohen's multistrategy firm Point72 as well as Ray Dalio's quantitative macro fund Bridgewater Associates, the sources said.The head of macroeconomic research at Entheos will be Stephen Modelfino, who previously spent six years at Bridgewater, according to the sources.Brian Cassese, a former senior analyst from Cetrulo's time at Point72, will also join the team. Joel Press of hedge fund consultancy Press Management and former head of Ernst and Young's hedge fund practice, will serve as an adviser on the operational side of the business, the sources said.  The fund will employ quantitative macroeconomic strategies and market-based research, according to Cetrulo's LinkedIn page. Before February 2018, many discretionary macro hedge funds suffered in the low-volatility post-financial crisis environment. As volatility has returned to the market with the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy and the rise in interest rates, discretionary macro funds have been outperforming the broader category of macro funds. Hedge Fund Research's macro Discretionary Thematic Index is up 0.77 percent in the year through June 2018, versus their broader Macro/CTA Index, which is down 1.81 percent over the same period. The research firm's HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index is down 0.85 percent in the year through June 2018.  ",1,1

"(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) has stopped accepting reusable cups and thermos flasks from customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to prevent the spread of coronavirus, though it will still honor the promised discount for anyone carrying one.The world's biggest coffee chain had announced a similar policy for the United States on Wednesday.Companies across the world are having to rethink the way they operate to slow the spread of a virus that first emerged in China, with some opting to freeze travel, stockpile goods and have staff work from home.For Starbucks that means pausing the use of personal cups or tumblers in its stores out ""of an abundance of caution"". Coffee chains have in recent years encouraged customers to bring their own reusable cups or thermal tumblers to cut the number of paper cups and plastic lids that end up in landfill. Many offer discounts or increased loyalty stamps to promote the trend.""We will continue to honor existing discounts for anyone who brings in a personal cup,"" Starbucks said. ""As a result, we are suspending our 5p (UK) and 5c (Germany) charges for paper cups as well, given this decision prevents customers from opting for reusables."" ",1,2
"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL) on Thursday said it was working to review and evolve its Chinese toothpaste brand, Darlie, the latest in a string of brand reassessments amid a U.S. debate on racial inequality. Darlie is a popular Chinese brand owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner, Hawley & Hazel. Its package features a smiling man in a top hat. It used to be called Darkie and featured a man in blackface.Its current Chinese name still translates to ""black person toothpaste."" The move comes as Corporate America reacts to weeks of protests over racial injustice and police brutality sparked by the death in May of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck. ""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging. We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told Reuters in an email. Colgate's statement to Reuters followed news on Wednesday that PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) was dropping its Aunt Jemima logo, prompting peers to initiate reviews of other food brands featuring African American characters, including Uncle Ben's rice, Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and Cream of Wheat. Darlie controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 45% in Taiwan, according to Euromonitor International. Colgate paid $50 million in 1985 for 50 percent of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darkie. It announced changes to the logo and English name in 1989 following pressure from shareholders and other groups. ",1,2

""The mood music is pretty good, and that has not always been so in these things.""It kept alive hopes that MSCI's 49-country world index and Europe's STOXX 600 could both avoid their first weekly falls since the start of October, but it was touch and go and others had little chance.Emerging market stocks were down 1.7% for the week, after a violent escalation of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong had left the Hang Seng down 4.7%, its worst weekly performance in four months. Chinese blue-chip shares ended the day down 0.75% and 2.4% for the week, which was their biggest fall since August.

The euro was barely changed at $1.1023 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was off just 0.02% at 98.129.Higher U.S. Treasury yields also illustrated the risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.845% from a U.S. close of 1.815% on Thursday.The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6101% from 1.593% on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a U.S. recession, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.BULLS VS CHINA Government borrowing costs in Germany and France also inched up on Friday, but were set for sizeable weekly declines, in contrast to southern European countries that have come under heavy selling pressure again this week.Germany's 10-year Bund yield was at -0.33%, off more than one-week lows hit on Thursday.

Dutch 10-year bond yields are down 7 bps this week, and French yields are 5 bps lower,.Data on Thursday had showed Germany's economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter, with consumer spending helping the country to avoid a mild contraction and a technical recession of two quarters of economic shrinkage.""In general, there has been risk aversion in recent days and a shift to core bond markets from the periphery,"" said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at DZ Bank.Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the United States and China aimed at ending their 16-month-long trade war. China's commerce ministry said the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions on the first-phase trade pact, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal.China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat, which the U.S. Trade Representative said would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.Those developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have U.S. President Donald Trump deny that any such deal had been agreed to.The new record for the S&P, which gained just 0.08% to 3,096.63, came despite a grim outlook from network gear maker Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) that underlined the impact of trade uncertainty.In commodity markets, U.S. crude prices seesawed after sliding Thursday on rising U.S. crude inventories.

"By Laurence Frost and Toby SterlingPARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM's (PA:AIRF) French unions on Monday criticised calls by their Dutch counterparts for KLM to be given greater autonomy, amid signs that a multibillion-euro coronavirus bailout is increasing tensions within the airline group.""It's an illusion to think KLM would fare better without Air France,"" the French carrier's unions said in an open letter responding to comments last week by Dario Fucci, head of the KLM works council.France agreed last month to issue or guarantee 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in loans to Air France, with another 2-4 billion pledged to KLM by the Dutch government.But the rescue package, designed to see the group through the virus pandemic that has crippled the global airline sector, also stoked concern in the Netherlands over possible French nationalisation in a later capital increase.The French and Dutch governments each own close to 14% of Air France-KLM, which declined to comment on the exchange of barbs between its unions.In Dutch media interviews, the KLM union chief suggested the relationship between the airlines and the combined Air France-KLM holding company should be loosened in response to the ""exploding"" debt on the Air France side.""The prenuptial agreement will have to change,"" Fucci was quoted as saying in De Telegraaf newspaper. ""We want to buy fuel and sell tickets together, but that's the end of it.""The response from Air France colleagues was backed by nine of their unions including the main SNPL pilots' grouping.""When Air France bought KLM in 2004, KLM was nearly bankrupt,"" their open letter said on Monday.Since then, it added, ""KLM has experienced exponential growth, taking full advantage of access to the French market, which ... remains one of the largest, most attractive and most lucrative in the world."" The riposte came as Dutch lawmakers were preparing on Tuesday to discuss government plans to contribute up to 4 billion euros in direct and state-guaranteed loans for KLM.The bailout was announced after Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith, who has pushed in vain for closer integration between the two airlines, gave up his 2020 bonus under Dutch government pressure.

China has denied mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and help fight extremism.When asked about U.S. government warnings over supply chain risks linked to Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that allegations of forced labour were fabrications.""Some people in the U.S. keep on saying they care about ethnic minorities in Xinjiang while also taking all kinds of measures to oppress Xinjiang companies,"" he said at a daily news conference in Beijing. He said this showed their hypocrisy and desire to suppress Xinjiang's development. In a call with reporters, Krach said the complex nature of supply chains was making companies vulnerable to potential risks and urged them to be more vigilant. He did not say how many U.S. companies might have been entangled in such supply chains.  ",0,0

"By Ritvik CarvalhoLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks drifted lower on Friday as the latest exchange of trade threats between the United States and China dampened risk appetite, while Italian bonds and shares in the country's banks sold off on signs of renewed government tensions in Rome.The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down by 0.1 percent after the start of European trading, and set to break a four-week streak of gains.While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent, though it was down over half a percent on the week.The trade row between the world's top two economies intensified midweek after President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent U.S. tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing vowed to retaliate.Investors were also cautious before the July U.S. jobs report due later in the day. This will give a reading on the health of the world's largest economy, now in its second longest expansion on record. Economists polled by Reuters expect 190,000 jobs were created in July.""The stock market trend continues to be characterized by a struggle between trade war distress, growth risks and strong corporate Q2 reports,"" SEB strategists wrote in a note to clients.According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year.Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit its highest in over three weeks, extending sharp gains made the previous day, while the euro fell to its lowest level since the end of June. Investors said the greenback was benefiting from safe haven flows.Italian two-year and five-year government bond yields rose about 22 to 25 basis points to 1.27 percent and 2.32 percent in early trade, hitting their highest levels since early June. Italian bank stocks fell 0.8 percent, set for their worst week since early June. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is under pressure from within the government to raise spending and challenge European Union budget rules.The possibility that he might be forced to resign has investors worried that Italy could go on a spending binge, or even that fresh elections could follow. That in turn could strengthen the hand of the eurosceptic League party and its leader, Matteo Salvini. The two- and five-year bonds have been most sensitive to concern over the chance of an Italian exit from the euro, which would increase default risk on debt coming due soon. ""Clearly, this is about the fear that Tria gets kicked out, which could lead to a collapse of the government, new elections, and the League gaining even further,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Christoph Rieger. ""Or it may mean that they agree on a budget that's at odds with the EU,"" he said, adding that this would imply heavier borrowing and greater bond supply.Yields on 10-year bonds also rose, by 9 basis points, to hit 3 percent for the first time since June 11, and the closely watched spread over Germany was at its widest since late June at 257 bps,. [GVD/EUR]With the trade tensions encouraging demand for safe haven assets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield pulled back to 2.9767 percent from a 10-week high above 3 percent brushed midweek. [US/]The 10-year Treasury yield had hit the peak partly due to a surge in Japanese government bond yields to 1-1/2-year highs this week as the market tested the Bank of Japan's rejigged policy framework, under which it now allows yields to fluctuate in a wider band.Oil prices eased back slightly after the previous day's rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week.

"SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) reported its lowest monthly global sales in a decade in February as the coronavirus outbreak hurt demand, in what is the first major indicator of damage to the broader auto sector from the epidemic.It turned in a preliminary sales figure of 275,044 vehicles for the month, 13% below 315,820 vehicles sold a year earlier. Hyundai last reported sales lower than this in February 2010.South Korea's Hyundai, which with affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) is the world's No.5 car maker, is the first major automaker to announce sales for the month. Chinese and U.S. players will turn in their numbers in the coming weeks. The flu-like virus, which originated in China, has killed nearly 3,000 and roiled global financial markets as investors and policymakers brace for a steep knock to world growth. South Korea has the most cases of infections outside the mainland, with the total at 4,212, affecting companies like Hyundai and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).""Inside South Korea is now more urgent than China,"" Korea Investment & Securities analyst Kim Jin-woo wrote in a note. ""With sluggish consumption affecting demand on top of it all, means auto sales are certain to be hit in the first quarter, and the impact expected to continue until at least the beginning of the second quarter."" Hyundai was the first major automaker to flag a hit to its manufacturing outside China when it halted production at home, its biggest manufacturing base, in February due to a shortage of parts from China.While the automaker has gradually resumed output, virus-related uncertainties remain. Just last week, a worker at its factory complex in the southeastern South Korean city of Ulsan tested positive for the virus, prompting it to shut a factory. The plant, which makes popular models such as the Palisade sport utility vehicle, resumed production on Monday, a Hyundai spokesman said. South Korean coronavirus cases are concentrated in the fourth-largest city of Daegu and the North Gyeongsang province, home to about 20% of auto parts suppliers in the country, Statistics Korea data shows.

"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that he made a ""large"" bet on insurer Brighthouse Financial late last year, and had made money on General Motors (NYSE:GM) but lost by shorting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought into Brighthouse, MetLife's former U.S. retail life-insurance business, at an average cost of $57.92, according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters. The stock is now trading at $63.90.The fund manager said General Motors, which was his firm's biggest winner last year, remains ""significantly under valued"" given the automaker's ""impressive fundamental performance.""But Einhorn also said he again lost money by betting that a group of fast-growing technology stocks, including Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla, would fall. ""The biggest losers for the year were our short positions on the 'bubble basket',"" Einhorn wrote.Greenlight Capital, whose annualized 15.4 percent return over more than two decades make it one of the world's most closely watched hedge funds, posted only a modest return in 2017. The firm's 1.6 percent gain trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 21.8 percent gain and Einhorn said it was a tough year for so-called value investors like himself.""While it feels like we have been running face first into the wind, we don't intend to capitulate and are sticking to our strategy of being long (on) misunderstood value and shorting 'not value',"" he wrote.Greenlight made money on German energy company Uniper and performance chemicals business Chemours, and took new stakes in offshore rigs operator Ensco and social media company Twitter.Time Warner was bought again because Greenlight thinks the planned merger with AT&T (NYSE:T) will go through. And if it doesn't, ""TWX has several strategic options to create value,"" said Einhorn.Einhorn was candid about his losses, noting that his bet on pharmacy retailer Rite Aid, in which he invested at $7.45 a share, did not turn out the way he expected. He exited at $2.78 a share.Greenlight is still betting that the price of gold will rise, but Einhorn said the firm lost money on the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and got out. ""We don't need additional exposure to mining equities to express that view,"" he wrote. ",1,2

"By John IrishPARIS (Reuters) - Hungary's foreign minister on Thursday accused major Western European nations of ""hypocrisy"" and ""hysteria"" for criticizing central European countries' business dealings with China, and defended Hungary's use of Huawei 5G mobile phone technology.Sixteen central and eastern European countries, including 11 European Union members, held a summit with China in April during which it pledged to increase trade and provide more support for big cross-border infrastructure projects.The area is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.France and Germany oppose such independent moves, which they fear might make Europe appear disunited at a time when the EU is trying to forge a more defensive strategy towards China.On Tuesday, speaking to reporters in Paris, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticized ""negotiations of 16 states from the east with China in parallel to negotiations that the EU is leading with China"".But Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto rejected such criticism, saying Germany and France do far more business with China than the central European states, and often negotiate directly with Beijing.""There is such a bad hypocrisy in the European Union when it comes to China,"" Szijjarto told Reuters on the sidelines of an OECD meeting in Paris. ""The 11 central and eastern European member states ... represent 9.9 percent of EU trade with China.""""When the German chancellor and French president meet China's leadership nobody thinks that's a problem,"" he said. ""Nobody raises a question about how it is possible that they sell 300 aircraft to China, which is a bigger deal than the (entire) trade represented by the 11 central European countries."" He said it was also unfair for Western European states to criticize Hungary for using technology from Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G mobile phone networks, when those networks were being built under license by German and British companies, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD).The United States and some of its European allies are pushing countries to exclude Huawei technology from their infrastructure, arguing that the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker could pose a security threat. Huawei denies that its technology could be misused by the Chinese state. The Hungarian mobile phone licenses were ""signed by the biggest German and British telecommunications companies, and then the Germans, British and French accuse us of opening up our market to Huawei,"" Szijjarto said.""When it comes to China it's a matter of competition. Instead of crying, instead of making hysteria and accusing central European countries, we should strengthen ourselves and be ready for the competition."" ",1,2

"LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) is to assume direct leadership of the British retailer's troubled clothing business after sacking the division's boss.Jill McDonald, clothing, home & beauty managing director, is leaving the business after less than two years in the job, M&S said on Thursday. Group CEO Steve Rowe will take over the leadership of the division directly in the near term, it added.""The business now needs to move on at pace to address long-standing issues in our clothing and home supply chain around availability and flow of product,"" said Rowe.""Given the importance of this task to M&S I will be overseeing this program directly.""Rowe did praise McDonald for strengthening the clothing team, improving the quality and style of product and setting a clear direction for the business to attract a younger family age customer.McDonald joined M&S in October 2017 to take on one of the biggest jobs in British fashion, having previously been the chief executive of bicycles and car parts company Halfords (L:HFD). Her appointment raised questions from some because she had no clothing retail experience.After several failed relaunches over the past decade, the jury is out on whether the 135-year-old M&S can rise to the challenges posed by fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M in its clothing business.M&S set out its latest turnaround plan shortly afterretail veteran Archie Norman became chairman in September 2017 to work alongside Rowe, who became CEO in 2016 and has been with the company three decades.In May M&S reported a third straight drop in annual profit and its shares are down 30% from a year ago.McDonald was a Rowe hire. On appointment he highlighted her ""fantastic customer insight"" and a wealth of operational, retail and leadership experience developed at Halfords and fast-food giant McDonald's.M&S' clothing and home like-for-like sales fell 1.6% in its 2018-19 year.NOTABLE BY OMISSIONAt the group's annual meeting on Tuesday Rowe said it had been a ""troubled year"" for the clothing and home business.He said M&S had developed a strong team in clothing, name checking 2018 hires Jill Stanton, women's and kid's director, and Wes Taylor, the menswear director for bringing over 60 years clothing experience to the business.However, McDonald's name was notable by omission from Rowe'sspeech.The CEO said that while M&S had improved its clothing ranges in terms of fit, style and value for money it still had significant issues with availability.""I think here we've done much of the hard work on style and fit and it's the process that we need to change,"" Rowe said.""Further work (is needed) on getting size ratios correct, making sure we reduce the number of lines we’re running so we can buy deeper, concentrating on the big lines that we’re famous for across the UK,"" he said.Rowe forecast an improvement by the autumn.Industry publication Drapers reported in June that Topshop fashion director Maddy Evans was leaving the company to join M&S in a senior buying role.

"(Bloomberg) -- While many investors are getting anxious about the lateness of the economic and market cycle, it’s not yet time to abandon U.S. equities, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).“An increasing chunk of the investor base is of the view that one has to be already positioned for the next downturn,” strategists Mislav Matejka, Prabhav Bhadani and Nitya Saidanha wrote in a note Monday. “We continue to believe that S&P 500 will recoup the October correction, similar to what it achieved post- the February one.”A panoply of negatives has hit the U.S., and global, stocks since the start of October, starting with a rebound in benchmark Treasury yields, which has enhanced the appeal of risk-free investments. Worries over a peak in corporate earnings growth, a continuing escalation of trade tariffs, a slowdown in China’s domestic demand and a cooling in the outlook for technology products -- the iPhone prime among them -- have also dented sentiment.Against that, there’s no sign that the economy is rolling over just yet. And the JPMorgan team cited a series of other reasons not to throw in the towel on American equities:The strategists also took heart from the recent surge in volatility, saying the VIX, or the Cboe Volatility Index, has reached levels where stocks typically did well in subsequent months.Bottom line is the JPMorgan team calls for an “overweight” position in U.S. equities, where “positioning appears relatively light.” It has neutral positions on Europe, where politics remain challenging, and Japan, where a stronger yen could pose a headwind.",1,2

"(Reuters) -  Unilever  (AS:UNA) (L:ULVR) expects shareholders to support its plan to unify its headquarters in London and scrap its Dutch base and believes a potential law enacting an ""exit tax"" in the Netherlands would breach European Union law, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Speaking at a virtual conference hosted by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), CEO Alan Jope said Unilever's board was ""absolutely committed"" to its proposal and is expecting ""strong shareholder support."" Jope repeated Unilever's belief that the law proposed in the Netherlands by the opposition Green Left party, which would result in an 11 billion euro ($12.96 billion) tax bill to the Dutch government, was illegal, but noted that it was still in its infancy. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker said earlier this month that if the law gets enacted, its unification plans would change.""We're not going to speculate on all the many paths this could take, but if there's a high probability that exit would be associated with an 11 billion euro tax bill, obviously that wouldn't be in shareholders' interest,"" Jope said in a presentation broadcast on the internet. ""But personally, I think logic and common sense will prevail.""Unilever, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, is hosting meetings on Sept. 21 in Rotterdam and Oct. 12 in London for shareholders to vote. When asked about the current macroeconomic environment, Jope said a global economic downturn was ""absolutely inevitable but we don't know its depth or how it will play out by country.""He said gross margins could see pressure as its value brands become more popular. Still, the company's North American business is currently seeing ""sustained strength"", driven by hygiene products and food and market share gains online.Moving forward, Jope said Unilever should continue to deliver annual cost savings, grow its revenues and increase its margins, though the margin growth may not be as fast as it was in prior years.

"By Eric Onstad, Christoph Steitz and Esha VaishLONDON/FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (HK:1211) is looking at launching battery production in Europe, joining Asian rivals aiming to cash in on a green car revolution and threatening attempts by Brussels to nurture a home-grown industry.Keen to capture a European car battery value chain that will be worth an estimated 250 billion euros ($290 billion) by 2025, the European Commission launched an alliance of local companies last year aiming to build 10-20 huge battery factories.But only Sweden's Northvolt have plans for large lithium-ion battery factories in Europe so far and some leading European carmakers have already struck deals with Asian suppliers setting up in Hungary and Poland.""We are considering cell production outside of China and that includes Europe,"" Julia Chen, Global Sales Director at BYD Batteries, told Reuters, speaking about the production of both automotive and home storage batteries.BYD (SZ:002594), which also makes electric buses, cars and solar panels, said it was not clear where in Europe a battery site might be. ""It would be possible wherever there's a market.""The company, which is backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), joins Korea's  SK Innovation  (KS:096770), Japan's GS Yuasa Corp (T:6674) and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) <300750.SZ> in looking to locate battery plants in Europe.South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910), Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400) both have European factories due to open soon while China's GSR Capital already produces battery cells at a UK plant it bought from Nissan (T:7201).While Asian electric vehicle (EV) cell battery factories in Europe would bring jobs, Brussels is concerned companies in the bloc are missing out on a growth industry and risk becoming dependent on foreign technology.""We have to move fast because here we are in a global race. We need to prevent technological dependence on competitors,"" European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said at the launch of the European Battery Alliance's action plan in May.But some investors say they are wary of backing European EV battery suppliers after seeing local solar panel firms founder in the face of cheap Chinese imports over the past decade.European battery companies would need billions in EU support to rival Asian firms that have received similar state subsidies and Brussels may be better off promoting next-generation solid-state EV batteries instead, investors say.""I don't believe anyone in Europe can be competitive with the Asians,"" said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital, which advises firms in the energy, technology and power infrastructure sectors.For a graphic showing European EV battery supply and demand: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOX'GREEN' BATTERIESElectric and hybrid vehicles are expected to account for 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants CRU, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year.Global automakers plan to invest at least $90 billion in electric cars and batteries, the most expensive component in the vehicles, to finance hundreds of new models over the next five years.For now, carmakers in Europe have been importing batteries from Asia, but as production ramps up that will become less viable. Setting up production in Europe would cut shipping costs by a quarter, consultancy P3 Group.But some carmakers are not waiting for a European industry, instead signing contracts with Asian firms coming to the region.German's BMW (DE:BMWG) said it was not involved in the European alliance while Europe's biggest automaker, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said it plans to get batteries from LG Chem's Polish factory due to open this year. Mercedes maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) has awarded a contract to CATL.The European Commission's plan calls for 110 million euros in battery related research, help for projects from a 2.7 billion euro EU innovation fund and the development of an EU ""green battery"" trademark.Supporters of the initiative argue Europe can carve out a niche by selling green batteries produced with renewable energy and ethically sourced raw materials.FINANCING ROUNDNorthvolt, which has held talks with European automakers, aims to launch its $5 billion gigafactory in late 2020 and produce 32 gigawatt hours of battery capacity each year by 2023.But investors have been cautious about pouring money into new European battery ventures.Northvolt's first financing round, intended to raise 80 million euros to 100 million euros to help set up a test factory, took slightly longer than expected, a spokesman said.In the end, the bulk of the financing was provided by the Swedish Energy Agency and the European Investment Bank, which provided a loan of up to 52.5 million euros. Much of the profit from the battery value chain is generated by producers of raw materials, such as cobalt and lithium, and those who assemble cells into complex systems, experts say.""There's been a bit of imbalance in that value chain and that's one of the reasons you see a limited amount of players in Europe,"" said Northvolt founder and Chief Executive Peter Carlsson. ""But we think that the model that we're applying is changing this.""Carlsson, who used to work for U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla (O:TSLA), says Northvolt can make a profit through economies of scale, by using cheap hydropower and controlling the processing of raw materials.But Northvolt and TerraE will probably need about $2 billion each in government funding to build their gigafactories - given the state support provided for similar projects in Asia and the United States, said Asad Farid, an associate director at private bank Berenberg who specializes in battery technology.Four months after the European alliance launch the world's biggest automotive supplier, Germany's Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] abandoned plans to make battery cells, saying it was too risky.SOLID-STATE SOLUTION?Investors are wary because of their experience with solar panel manufacturers as well as rapid advances in technology that are slashing the price of battery packs, which consultants Arthur D puts at $190-250 per kilowatt hour now.""In battery manufacturing ... it's very much about scale. So the established producers in Korea, China and Japan have clear advantages over new entrants,"" said Simon Webber, lead portfolio manager on the global & international equities team at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) .Tim Crockford, who manages Hermes Investment Management's Impact Opportunities Fund, said he was more interested in European firms researching cathode technology, areas with major barriers to entry in terms of research and development.""The attraction of the industry decreases as you move further down the value chain. Things like battery manufacturers and the battery pack assemblers, it's much more fragmented market with lower barriers to entry,"" said Crockford.While Hermes has avoided companies mass-producing EV cell batteries it has taken stakes in a lithium producer and a company that makes materials for battery cathodes, he said.The lithium-ion batteries used now are also likely to be overtaken in a matter of years by so-called solid-state technology that is expected to produce even cheaper batteries with higher energy density.""The development cycle and the speed of technology progress in batteries is so huge at the moment, there's an opportunity for new and additional players to enter,"" said Timo Moeller, head of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility overview in Cologne.Developers in Europe believe that gives the region an opportunity to catch up.""Everybody is developing solid-state batteries so the gap (with Asia) will be narrower and narrower as we go along,"" said Diego Pavia, CEO of InnoEnergy, a sustainable energy company that has invested in Northvolt.

"By Abhinav RamnarayanLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday, as worries about a threatened U.S. military strike against Iran and a global trade conflict took the edge off a central bank-induced rally from earlier in the week.The New York Times said U.S. President Donald Trump approved military strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for the downing of an unmanned surveillance drone, then pulled back from launching the attacks. Iranian officials told Reuters on Friday that Tehran had received a message from U.S. President Donald Trump through Oman warning that a U.S. attack on Iran was imminent.Worries over possible military strikes persist, and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell from a seven-week high, driven mostly by weakness in Asian stocks. A rally by European stocks also faded, though a pan-European index was higher on the day. "" ... Market risk hasn't been switched off, it's merely gone dim,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets. ""However, it does appear equity markets are tired and may be suffering from a bit of a hangover after partying it up to post FOMC.""A Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting this week opened the door to rate cuts in the United States. Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15%. The index was still up nearly 4% on the week, during which it reached its highest level since May 8.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5%, Australian stocks declined 0.6% and Japan's Nikkei shed 0.8%.The promise of rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has kept sentiment strong in stock markets.

""While lower real rates in the U.S. and globally make gold more attractive, the metal is being increasingly viewed as a cardinal asset to hedge against the scrim of unpredictability like the fear of recession and war,"" Innes said.Meanwhile, China and the United States are set to resume trade talks before Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet next week in Japan. Hopes of an agreement grew after the two leaders talked by telephone call, but neither side has signaled a shift from positions that led to an impasse last month.The Fed's signal that rate cuts were likely brought some relief, but also raised the specter of a global currency war. On Friday, the dollar fell against a basket of six major currencies to a two-week low of 96.495. The index has shed roughly 1% this week.The dollar has fallen 1.35% versus the yen this week, reaching a six-month low of 107.045 yen on Friday.In oil markets, U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.46% at $57.33 per barrel. They had surged more than 5% the previous day after Iran shot down the U.S. drone. ",0,0
"Investing.com - A look at the top five things that rocked markets this past week.Earnings Season Kicked into Full Gear US stocks shrugged off a possible US government shutdown to close at record highs as ongoing optimism over earnings spurred investor appetite for risker assets.Financials got the week off to a good start amid quarterly earnings report from US Bancorp (NYSE:USB),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that beat Wall Street estimates, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bucked the trend, reporting its first quarterly loss since 2011.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) quarterly report Thursday also garnered attention after the tech company reported quarterly revenue growth for the first time in twenty-three quarters as its move into cloud, artificial intelligence and block chain technology offset declines from its traditional software business.The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.WTI Crude Oil Snapped 4-Week Winning Streak The weekly streak of gains in crude oil prices came to an abrupt end this week as investors weighed the impact of rising US production on OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies amid comments from the IEA.The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report, warned that rising non-OPEC production would offset a raft of positive factors supporting oil prices including ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.Crude oil futures settled at $61.44, down 58 cents.Pound, Sterling Downed the DollarIt was another miserable week for the dollar as it struggled to find its footing amid a surge in both the pound and sterling.EUR/USD notched its fifth-straight weekly win, rising above four-year highs despite European Central Bank (ECB) officials’ attempts to quash investor expectations that the central bank would announce plans to unwind its massive stimulus programme at next week’s meeting.GBP/USD rose to its highest since the June 2016 Brexit vote amid growing expectations that the Bank of England would soon have to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating.Gold Fought Off Pressure From Soaring US Government Bond Yields Gold prices held above four-month highs this week despite coming under pressure from a surge in government bond yields to multi-year highs.Yields on United States 10-Year this week rose to their highest since 2014 amid strong China economic growth data and rising expectations for faster inflation growth.Macquarie said that risks of a reversal in gold prices are rising, as it is “harder for gold to ignore the impressive snapback in real yields” since the turn of the year.Crypto-Market Crashed. Attempted Recovery. But Remains Under Pressure. A sea of red swept over crypto-markets this week after a crypto-crash Tuesday through Wednesday unfolded in markets, wiping billions of dollars from the market as investors fled positions amid fears that China and Korea were planning a ban on cryptocurrency-related activity.The total cryptocurrency market cap slumped to a low of about $478 billion at the depths of the crash on Wednesday before rebounding to about $562 billion Friday. That is markedly lower than the $829 billion total market cap peak set less than two weeks ago on Jan. 7.As the sell-off deepened, Ripple XRP fell to a low of $0.87 on the poloniex exchange, Ethereum fell to a low of $770, Bitcoin fell to a low $9,231. The ‘big 3’ cryptocurrencies by market cap, however, have since recovered some of their losses but remain under pressure.",1,2

"(Reuters) - Investment firm Third Point LLC and  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) squared off over plans for the company's future on Tuesday, with the hedge fund pushing for hiring a ""highly qualified"" chief executive officer and the company saying it was already searching for a permanent chief. Third Point, the $17 billion hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, unveiled a 100-day plan that includes reviewing the company's recently concluded strategic review and reevaluating its planned divestitures, hiring a ""world-class permanent CEO"" and refreshing the company's core legacy products.The company said the hedge fund ""simply and effectively copied and pasted the actual plan outlined by Campbell"", adding that the plan was not thoroughly thought out.""Vote for us and we'll think of something,"" the company said about Third Point's plan.Loeb has nominated 12 directors, including an heir of Campbell's controlling family, to replace all board members at the Nov. 29 annual meeting, in what will be the season's most contentious proxy battle.But he faces a high hurdle with other heirs controlling roughly 40 percent of the company.Loeb and his nominees are set to make their case to influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Tuesday that will issue a report in several weeks.Campbell has been hurt by falling soup sales and a higher debt burden in the wake of its Snyder's-Lance acquisition. Its former chief executive, Denise Morrison, left abruptly in May and has been replaced by board member Keith McLoughlin on an interim basis.The company said on Tuesday it was already searching for a permanent chief, with Third Point saying the proxy contest would make it difficult for Campbell to attract top talent. The hedge fund said Bill Toler, a member of its slate and CEO of Hostess Brands, would be prepared to step in as interim CEO if needed. Third Point last week sued Campbell in a New Jersey court alleging that the company misled investors with incorrect statement. A ruling could come as soon as Friday which could potentially allow the hedge fund's lawyers to question Campbell board members Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance. ",1,2
"By Joey RouletteCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched the first batch of 60 small satellites into low-Earth orbit on Thursday for Musk's new Starlink internet service.A Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellites blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at about 10:30 p.m. local time (0230 GMT Friday), clearing a key hurdle for a business venture that Musk hopes will generate much-needed cash for his larger ambitions in space.The launch came a week after two back-to-back countdowns for the mission were scrubbed - once due to high winds over the Cape and the next night in order to update satellite software and ""triple-check"" all systems.The 60 satellites flown into space were released into orbit as planned about an hour after Thursday's launch, and the Falcon 9's main-stage reusable booster rocket flew back to Earth for a successful landing on a barge floating in the Atlantic.SpaceX said it would probably take another day to learn whether all the satellites deployed were functioning properly. Each weighs about 500 pounds (227 kg), making them the heaviest payload carried aloft by SpaceX to date.They represent the initial phase of a planned constellation capable of beaming signals for high-speed internet service from space to paying customers around the globe.Musk has said he sees the new Starlink venture as an important new revenue stream for his California-based Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, whose launch service income he expects to top out at around $3 billion a year.He told reporters last week that makes Starlink pivotal in helping pay for his larger goals of developing a new spacecraft to fly paying customers to the moon and for eventually trying to colonize Mars.""We think this is a key stepping stone on the way toward establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the moon,"" said billionaire Musk, who is also chief executive officer of automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. At least 12 launches carrying similar payloads are needed to achieve constant internet coverage of most of the world, Musk said. For now, Starlink is only authorized for U.S. operations.Musk faces stiff competition. Airbus SE-backed OneWeb launched its own clutch of satellites in February, while LeoSat Enterprises and Canada's Telesat are also working to build data networks. In each network, the tiny satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites, a technological shift made possible by advances in laser technology and computer chips.Musk said SpaceX would begin approaching customers later this year or next year. As many as 2,000 satellites will be launched per year, with the ultimate objective of placing up to 12,000 into orbit. ",1,2
"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com --   BP   (LON:BP) chief executive Bob Dudley bowed out on the sweetest of high notes on Tuesday, raising the company’s dividend less than a week after arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut the rate at which it returns cash to shareholders.The company raised its quarterly payout to 10.5 cents a share, from 10.25c previously, after its preferred measure of underlying profit fell less than expected in the fourth quarter of the year. According to data compiled by Investing.com, that takes the yield on one of the U.K. FTSE 100’s most reliable dividends up to 7%. The  BP  (LON:BP) share price rose 4.5% in response, while the FTSE 100 rose only 1.2%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.0%.By contrast, Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut its buyback plans for this year by 60%, and while it left its dividend untouched, the accompanying rise in net debt put questions marks over its ability to stay so free with its cash. Shell, for its part, is now yielding 7.39%. BP  (LON:BP), at least, is bringing in more cash in these days than it used to. The acquisition of BHP’s shale assets in the U.S. kept the expected decline in upstream profit to less than one-third, and the headwinds from the Gulf of Mexico spill a decade ago continue to drop: this year, BP will pay less than $1 billion in costs related to that accident, down from $2.4 billion last year.But the sustainability of the new dividend is still likely to be tested. Production is likely to fall from last year’s average of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the current quarter due to the ongoing disposal program, while the company also expects lower refining margins and bigger discounts for its heavier north American crude blends. Most worrying, naturally, is the impact of the novel coronavirus on global oil demand. Chief financial officer Brian Gilvary told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the company sees the virus wiping out one-third of all forecast demand growth this year – a reality check to those still hoping for a V-shaped rebound in global demand and economic activity. Gilvary said the demand destruction is likely to be in the range of 300,000-500,000 barrels a day. Brent crude prices dropped below $55 a barrel for the first time since the end of 2018 on Tuesday, before recovering to trade at $54.86 a barrel by 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT).  BP  (LON:BP) has set itself the target of generating a return on average capital employed of over 10% at that price level by 2021, while keeping gearing below 30%.Given that  BP  (LON:BP) and other majors weren’t able to cover their capex and dividends at even $60 a barrel the last time oil prices collapsed in 2015/6, this represents some remarkable progress. But, as Tuesday’s presentation made clear, it depends on rapid sales of marginal assets. BP is targeting over $15 billion in disposal proceeds by the middle of next year. The company may be well on top of its core projects, but unless crude prices turn around, the risk is that it will have to sell some of its better assets to meet that target. ",1,2
"(Bloomberg) -- Slowing economic growth, shrinking central bank balance sheets and continued bouts of volatility will help make 2019 another poor year for risk-adjusted investment returns, with few obvious havens, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).“Expect better but still low returns in 2019” for multi-asset global allocation portfolios, Goldman strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissman wrote in a note Monday. While the decline in valuations across asset classes has improved the medium-term outlook, “we see a weaker expected macro backdrop in 2019 as likely to limit return potential,” they wrote.The gloomy outlook matches the experience of what’s been a rough year for financial markets. Investors have been rattled by everything from monetary policy normalization to tariff threats to global trade, a slowdown in China and the prospect that corporate-earnings growth has peaked. In what some have called a regime change, bonds have also been poor hedges for equities, upending the classic 60-40 portfolio strategy.For their part, the Goldman strategists still advise an overweight allocation to stocks, but recommend a bigger holding of cash than benchmarks suggest and have an underweight call on bonds. The team downgraded credit to underweight last week.“We still see poor risk-adjusted returns in fixed income: we forecast negative total returns for bonds with more upward pressure on yields and credit spreads” in the first half of next year, they wrote. “There may be less reason to be bearish” on bonds by the latter part of 2019, as 10-year Treasuries “could reprice in the event of a more severe growth slowdown or deeper equity drawdown,” they said.While far from catastrophic, this year is set to go down as one of the worst years for risk-adjusted cross-asset returns outside of crisis periods over the past quarter century, Goldman analysis indicates.Though questions are emerging about the “strategic case” for commodities, Goldman has an overweight call on the asset class, with “significant near-term upside to oil” after the big tumble in crude the past two months. The team favors gold, with the dollar expected to weaken next year.With the traditional bond hedge to equities unattractive, Goldman has also recommended that investors consider derivatives. With higher volatility, one tactic could involve selling calls on equities and buying puts after rallies, and buying calls and selling puts after “sharp corrections,” the strategists wrote separately last week.",0,0

"By Marc JonesLONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis will see the world's biggest firms slash dividend payouts between 17%-23% this year or what could be as much as $400 billion, a new report has shown, although sectors such as tech are fighting the trend.Global dividend payments plunged $108 billion to $382 billion in the second quarter of the year, fund manager Janus Henderson has calculated, equating to a 22% year-on-year drop which will be the worst since at least 2009. All regions saw lower payouts except North America, where Canadian payments proved to be resilient. Worldwide, 27% of firms cut their dividends, while worst affected Europe saw more than half do so and two thirds of those cancel them outright.""2020 will see the worst outcome for global dividends since the global financial crisis,"" Janus Henderson said in a report published on Monday.""We now expect headline global dividends to fall 17% in a best-case scenario, paying $1.18 trillion... Our worst-case scenario could see payouts drop 23% to $1.10 trillion."" (Graphic: Global dividends total since 2009 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkzddevm/Pasted%20image%201598005728376.png) A break down of the various sectors showed some big differences too.Banks and other financial firm that have been ordered by the European Central Bank to stop paying dividends accounted for half of the 45% reduction in Europe's Q2 dividend drop to $77 billion.Miners and oil firms were hit badly by the broad slump in commodity prices and consumer discretionary companies saw their operations hard hit by government lockdowns too, resulting in much lower payments.In contrast, tech and telecoms and healthcare firms' dividends were relatively unaffected, with dividends up 1.8% and 0.1% respectively on an underlying basis. (Graphic: Banks, retailers and media dividends slammed but tech powering on - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwayedpw/Pasted%20image%201598005233292.png) That big tech resilience has also helped Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Apple (O:AAPL) power their way into the top ten of world dividend payers for the first time this year. That list is still topped by Nestle (S:NESN). ""Dividend trends are reflecting the trends in society and the stock market at the moment,"" said Janus Henderson's head of global equity income, Ben Lofthouse.""Probably we are going to see increases from parts of the tech sector,"" he added. ""There are a lot of very strong balance sheets in that area.""Going forward, he said, some key factors will determine how strong the recovery in dividends will be. The most obvious is the path of the coronavirus, but there is also what U.S. firms do later this year and whether Europe's banks get the green light early next year to restart their payments.""The big question for the U.S. is what will happen in the fourth quarter. If many companies make significant cuts to their dividends, payouts will be fixed at a lower level until towards the end of 2021.""

"By Sankalp Phartiyal, Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Aditya KalraMUMBAI/BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart's board is yet to finalize a deal to sell a controlling stake to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, adding a deal could just be days away.Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified sources, that Flipkart's board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion.A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart's board had ""in-principle"" approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved.The first two sources said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan's SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said.""SoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,"" one of the sources said.Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion.Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show.Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.AMAZON OFFEREarlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer.Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart's biggest rival in India.Amazon's move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers.Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said.Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country's antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters.A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested ""innovations or remedies.""""This definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,"" he added.Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm.Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester.Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.

"TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) workers began a brief strike on Wednesday over plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs in response to the coronavirus crisis, which has stripped demand for jets as airlines cope with a plunge in tourism and business travel.Unions said up to 8,000 workers were expected to join the action scheduled to last 1.5 hours in Toulouse, France, where employees were preparing to march alongside one of the runways at Toulouse-Blagnac airport overlooked by Airbus headquarters.The airport was due to remain open.""Airbus has a real responsibility to get to grips with its restructuring which is excessive and gives a terrible example to suppliers,"" said Jean-Francois Knepper, who represents the Force Ouvriere union.In Germany, the IG Metall union urged Airbus to avoid forced redundancies at the planemaker or its Premium AEROTEC unit.Unions have called a wider day of action in French plants on Thursday.Asked to comment on the protests, Airbus referred back to a statement last week by CEO Guillaume Faury that it was facing the ""gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced"" and was committed to limiting the social impact of its reorganisation.Airbus has said a third of the 15,000 jobs are set to go in France included 3,378 in the southwestern city of Toulouse where it assembles wide-body jets and some smaller A320s.Europe's largest aerospace group has historically enjoyed stable labour relations with its unions and strikes are rare. Workers staged a similar protest during a smaller restructuring exercise in 2008, when Airbus avoided compulsory layoffs.Facing the industry's worst crisis over the impact of worldwide lockdowns, Airbus has refused to rule out forced redundancies this time round but sketched out concessions in return for extensions in furlough schemes and research aid.

"By Jörn Poltz and Douglas BusvineMUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - German health group  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG) said on Sunday it was buying  Varian Medical  Systems Inc (N:VAR) of the United States for $16.4 billion in a deal that seeks to create the global leader in cancer care solutions.The deal is the first major growth move by Healthineers since it was spun off and floated in 2018 by Siemens (DE:SIEGn), which is undertaking a broader shakeup of its conglomerate structure to create room for its business units to do their own deals.Siemens, which will retain control over Healthineers, will provide bridge financing for the deal that will be partly refinanced by a rights issue by the medical technology unit later this year.Under the agreed transaction, Healthineers will acquire all shares in Varian for $177.50 each in cash, representing a 24% premium to the U.S. company's closing price on Friday and 42% above its 30-day weighted average.""With this takeover, we are significantly strengthening our position - in addition to cardiology and neurology - in the field of oncology,"" Chief Financial Officer Jochen Schmitz told Reuters in an interview.CEO Bernd Montag rejected suggestions that Healthineers had overpaid for Varian. ""This is an icon in our industry,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""If you put it into perspective we achieved a sensible price.""Through the deal to buy Varian, Healthineers acquires the leader in radiation therapy with a market share of over 50%.Healthineers highlighted a long-term rise in the incidence of cancer - from 14 million cases worldwide in 2010 to a forecast 25 million in 2030. That translates into an addressable market of $20 billion that is forecast to grow at an annual rate of between 6% and 10%, the company said in a presentation on the deal.The transaction, first reported by Bloomberg, is subject to approval by Varian shareholders and regulators. It is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and be accretive to Siemens Healthineers' adjusted basic earnings per share within 12 months of that.""With Siemens Healthineers, we will transform care for a greater number of patients worldwide, as well as broaden opportunities for our employees as part of a larger and more global organization,"" Varian President and Chief Executive Officer Dow Wilson said. BALANCE SHEET SUPPORTConglomerate Siemens is effectively putting its balance sheet to work to fund the deal, providing a bridging loan of 15.2 billion euros ($17.9 billion) to Healthineers.The medical technology unit aims to replace 50% of that through a rights issue this year, subject to market conditions.Siemens said in a statement that it expressly welcomed the deal and would raise the money for the bridging loan by issuing bonds. It will not participate in the rights issue, meaning its stake in Healthineers will be diluted to about 72% from 85%.Siemens aims to maintain its A+ debt ratings, which put it firmly in investment grade.Healthineers also pre-released fiscal third quarter results instead of on Monday due to the acquisition announcement. They showed its revenue declined 6.9% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 3.3 billion euros due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Its adjusted operating margin was 13.9%, down 1.2 percentage points from the same period a year earlier, while adjusted basic earnings per share fell 21% to 30 euro cents.The company said it expects revenue to be flat in fiscal 2020 while adjusted basic earnings per share are seen at between 1.54 and 1.62 euros, compared to 1.70 euros last year, assuming the business environment does not deteriorate further.

"By Sankalp PhartiyalNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google will collaborate with India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say.Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost ""4G or even 5G"" smartphone that Reliance would design.The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as  Xiaomi  (HK:1810) and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India.Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.""If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,"" said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys.Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.""They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,"" said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron (TW:3231) and Flextronics. ""I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.""Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea (NS:VODA) and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment.Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CONTENT IS KINGThe alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps.Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel (O:INTC) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM), which could bolster its smartphone ambitions. While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up.The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters.That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.""This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,"" said Vohra.The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market.""I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,"" said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.

"Investing.com - A Trump Administration decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on goods imported from China set off a huge rally Tuesday that reclaimed most of Monday's losses.The Administration delayed the imposition of tariffs on some goods until Dec. 15, which should give retailers plenty of time to stock their shelves.""We're doing this for the Christmas season,"" President Donald Trump told reportersThe rally sent the S&P 500 up 1.48%, the Dow Jones industrials up 1.44% and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 2%.The gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq -- 42.57 points and 153 points, respectively -- recovered all of Monday's losses. The Dow, which gained about 373 points, ended the day about 7.5 points short of a total recovery from its 380-point loss on Monday.The Nasdaq 100 index, which has a concentration in big tech, jumped more than 2.2%. The index more than recovered its Monday loss, ending the day 82 points ahead of Friday's close.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), electronics retailer   Best Buy   (NYSE:BBY),   Nike   (NYSE:NKE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) were among the biggest winners from the decision.Apple rose 4.2% and contributed nearly 58 points to the Dow by itself. It was also the sixth-best performer among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The tariff delays were concentrated on a wide variety of goods that are big sellers in the holiday shopping season, including cell phones, tennis racquets, video game consoles, computer keyboards, footware and clothing.The White House had vowed to impose the tariffs on Sept. 1, but the announcement in late July unnerved markets, unleashing wild swings in U.S. stock prices. Tariffs will be imposed Sept. 1, on a number of products, including food products.The Dow was up nearly 530 points before some traders sold to lock in profits.

Brent crude rose $2.73 to $61.30 a barrel.Gold, however, fell back, with the December futures contract settling at $1,512.30 an ounce, off $5.But there remained worries about global growth as the trade fight between Washington and Beijing grinds on. Investors could see it in the narrowing spread between 2-year Treasury securities and the 10-year note. Many analysts believe a 10-year that's less than a 2-year yield (inversion) is a strong signal that a recession is coming.The 10-Year Treasury yield closed at 1.702%, after falling to as low as 1.618%. The 2-Year Treasury yield rose to 1.673%, bring the spread to just 2.9 basis points, or 2.9 one-hundredths of a percentage point.

"By Luis Valentin OrtizSAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Puerto Rico's federal oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline on the bankrupt island's government through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in law.Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico's legislature filed lawsuits in July claiming the board, which was created by the U.S. Congress under the so-called PROMESA Act in 2016, overstepped its power by imposing a belt-tightening fiscal plan and budget on the government that require public policy actions.The board, which sought to dismiss the litigation, argued that if it cannot impose reforms through a fiscal plan over the objections of the governor, ""then PROMESA created a toothless oversight board.""Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the PROMESA Act gives the board the power to make ""binding policy choices"" for the U.S. commonwealth despite the governor's objection. However, when it comes to policy measures dependent on the adoption of new laws or the modification or repeal of existing laws, the board ""has only budgetary tools and negotiations to use to elicit any necessary buy-in from the elected officials and legislators,"" the ruling stated.While the ruling empowered the board in fiscal matters, it also noted that only the Puerto Rico government can pass laws necessary to implement new fiscal policies.Swain noted that the PROMESA Act is ""an awkward power-sharing arrangement"" because Puerto Rico officials have the ability ""to obstruct implementation altogether or complicate it in such a way as to cripple Puerto Rico's ability to use it to promote the needed return to fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets.""With Puerto Rico sinking under roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, the board in May 2017 sought a form of bankruptcy restructuring in U.S. court.Rossello blasted the ruling for giving ""total budgetary authority to the unelected members of the oversight board, which supersede that of the elected officials of the Government of Puerto Rico and its legislature."" ""While we analyze the possibility of appealing the court's decision, we will keep looking for ways to work with the oversight board so that we avoid harsh, draconian measures that would be detrimental to our people,” he said in a statement.The oversight board said the ruling upholds its authority and urged the Puerto Rico government to fully implement the fiscal plans and budgets it certified.""There can be no doubt that the fiscal year 2019 budget certified by the oversight board is the only one and must be enforced,"" said Board Chairman José Carrión in a statement.""We call on all stakeholders to get back to work in the interests of Puerto Rico, in order to end decades of mismanagement and rebuild our island.”While the judge dismissed several counts in the governor's lawsuit largely on technical grounds, she kept other parts alive, rejecting the board's argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Swain dismissed the legislators' lawsuit in its entirety. ",1,2

"KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) ""cheated"" the country in dealings with state fund 1MDB and that U.S. authorities have promised to help return the fees the Wall Street bank earned from the fund.The U.S. investment bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise funds through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), which is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.Goldman's stock fell to a near two-year low on Monday after Malaysia's Minister of Finance Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a ""full refund"" of the around $600 million in fees the bank earned from raising $6.5 billion for the fund. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs on Monday said in an email to Reuters that the bank denied any wrongdoing. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, including some money that Goldman Sachs helped raise, by high-level officials of the fund and their associates from 2009 through 2014.U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers earlier this month. One of them, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.""There is evidence that Goldman Sachs has done things that are wrong,"" Mahathir said in an interview with U.S. news channel CNBC aired on Tuesday.""Obviously we have been cheated through the compliance by Goldman Sachs people,"" he said, without specifying details.The bank's compliance controls ""don't work very well"", he added.A second Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on Mahathir's comments in the interview.Asked by reporters later in Singapore if he had officially requested the DOJ to help return money that Goldman earned from 1MDB, Mahathir said:""It takes a little bit of time but they (DOJ) have promised that they will give back the money."" He was speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Singapore.The DOJ was not immediately available for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. Anwar Ibrahim, appointed successor to 93-year-old Mahathir, told parliament on Tuesday that the country needs to take ""more aggressive measures"" to reclaim the fees and losses ""due to the effects on Malaysia's image"".Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Finance Minister Lim repeated his stance that Malaysia wants to reclaim fees paid to Goldman Sachs, and added that the country will also seek consequential losses.""The Malaysian government will want to reclaim all the fees paid, as well as all the losses including the interest rate differential,"" Lim told reporters. He said the rate Malaysia paid was about 100 basis points higher than the market rate.Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly for planned investment.Lim did not say how Malaysia would seek to recoup any money beyond that he will leave the matter to Malaysia's attorney general.Citing sources, Reuters reported in June that Malaysia was considering asking the U.S. Justice Department to get Goldman Sachs to return the fees it had earned from the 1MDB deals.Malaysia's government, elected to power only in May, is scrambling to bring back funds that were allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB - a fund founded by former premier Najib Razak.The 1MDB scandal was a major reason for Najib's shock election loss. Najib has since been charged with corruption as part of Malaysia's investigation into 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, described by U.S. and Malaysian authorities as central to the 1MDB scandal, was charged by U.S. prosecutors this month. He remains at large. ",0,0

"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) overall vehicle registrations nearly halved in the U.S. state of California during the fourth quarter, according to a Dominion Cross-Sell report, which collates data from state motor vehicle records.The massive drop comes as tax credit for Tesla buyers ended in 2019. It had fallen to $3,750 at the start of the year and had halved to $1,875 in July.An existing $7,500 U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), which allows taxpayers to deduct a part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales, which Tesla hit in July 2018.The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plummeted 46.5% to 13,584 in the quarter ended December 2019, from 25,402 in the same period a year earlier.Model 3 registrations, which accounted for about three-fourth of the total, halved to 10,694.Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.""One can assume that Tesla has hit peak performance in the U.S. because they have not exceeded their 2018 results for five months now,"" said Shane Marcum, vice-president of Cross-Sell.The new data comes nearly two weeks after Tesla beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk after a few turbulent years.",0,0
"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com – Wall Street moved off session lows but remained under pressure Thursday, paced by selling in tech stocks as investors continued to assess the Covid-19 virus outbreak.The S&P 500 slipped 0.72%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.69%.It wasn’t immediately clear what triggered the sudden move lower in stocks. But reports of a sharp increase in infections in Beijing dampened hopes that China’s capital would be able to resume normal operations sooner rather than later.A hospital in Beijing has reported 36 new coronavirus cases as of Thursday, a sharp increase in the number of cases reported in the capital city, taking the total cases to 45, Chinese state-run Global Times reported.Beijing recently ramped up measures to prevent the spread of the virus including restrictions on movements and a ban on public gatherings that forced schools to shut down.Tech led the broader decline lower amid worries about prolonged disruptions to supply chains in China at a time when several companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), have cautioned on outlook as the virus outbreak continues.A slew of mixed earnings from corporates before the open, meanwhile, did little to help sentiment on stocks.Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) slumped 18% after the theme park operator delivered a softer outlook on profit and cut its dividend by nearly 70% amid a surprise loss in the fourth quarter.ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) plunged 17% to a 52-week low after its earnings missed estimates and guidance was weak.Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) bucked the trend, rising 19%, after its fourth-quarter losses were not as bad as Wall Street had estimates amid a ramp-up in activity on its housing platform.In deal news,   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) bought discount broker E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) for $13 billion, sending shares of latter up 24%.Some on Wall Street, however, were critical of the shares-only deal, which will dilute the bank’s stock, with   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) calling it “value destroying.” Wells Fargo downgraded Morgan Stanley to equal-weight from overweight and cut its price target on the stock to $58 from $65.",0,0

"MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian government panel has suggested creating an asset management company (AMC) to resolve bad loans above 5 billion rupees ($73 million), among steps to clean up the banking sector, the interim finance minister said on Monday.The panel of bankers was formed last month as lenders, already burdened by a near-record 9.5 trillion rupees of soured loans as of last year, reported a further rise in bad loans in the quarter to March after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules.""This is a completely bank-led resolution process and there is no immediate role for the government in this,"" minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in a late-night news conference, adding that banks can transfer bad assets to the AMC or an alternate investment fund depending on market conditions.Goyal, who is standing in for regular Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, also said that for small and medium sized industries with loans of up to 500 million rupees, a template will be made so that bank officials can decide within 90 days of a loan going sour how to resolve them.India's 21 state banks majority-owned by the government account for two-thirds of banking assets in the country and hold close to 90 percent of soured loans. The top banks include  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) and  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK).The bad loans problem, driven largely by infrastructure sectors including power, has stifled banks' ability to lend to new businesses to boost growth critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election by May.In an interview published on Monday, Modi said that he identified the problem of bad loans soon after taking office in 2014 and has been working to resolve it.

"By Hideyuki SanoTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit a record high on Thursday though concerns about the Trump administration's protectionist stance tempered enthusiasm in financial markets, while the dollar struggled after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin welcomed a weaker currency.European shares are expected to tick up slightly, with spread-betters seeing a small rise of 0.1 percent in Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's Cac. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3 percent to an all-time peak for the ninth session in a row.Japan's Nikkei fell 1.1 percent, hit by the dollar's decline against the yen.MSCI ACWI, the index provider's broadest gauge of the world's stock markets, boosted its gains for the month to 6.6 percent. It had registered declines only on two days this year amid optimism over an extended growth spurt in the global economy and solid earnings.A Reuters poll of over 500 economists showed the global economy is expected to grow at the fastest pace since 2010.The upbeat mood, however, has come up against renewed fears of protectionism after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels earlier in the week.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, hinted at action against China, saying U.S. trade authorities were investigating whether there is a case for taking action over China's infringements of intellectual property.Trump is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday.Also in the Swiss Alpine town, Mnuchin made a major departure from traditional U.S. currency policy on Wednesday, saying ""obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities."" Analysts say they cannot remember any U.S. Treasury Secretary openly embracing a cheaper dollar at least in the last two decades or so.""I was speculating the Trump administration may role out something with fanfare given its big delegation to Davos,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.""I'd think the real aim of Mnuchin's comments on the dollar is not so much engineering a weaker dollar per se as putting pressure on trading partners to do some trade deals with the administration,"" he added. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to a three-year low of 88.816, falling 1.9 percent so far this week.The euro rose to as high as $1.2459, a peak not scaled since December 2014, ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day.The meeting comes against a backdrop of heightened speculation over when it will end its vast stimulus and signal a rise in interest rates from record lows.The dollar slipped to 108.74 yen, its lowest levels since mid-September.The Chinese yuan also strengthened, gaining 0.5 percent to 6.3280 yuan per dollar in onshore trade, hitting its highest level since November 2015.It rose 2.7 percent so far this month. The gains, if sustained, would mark the biggest monthly rise ever. Gold jumped past its September peak to 1-1/2-year high of $1,365.8 per ounce.
