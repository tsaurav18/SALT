"(Bloomberg) -- With just three weeks to go, 2018’s market contrarians are proving prescient.The outlook was decidedly bullish for U.S. stocks and developing-nation assets 12 months ago, with both forecast to build upon a stellar 2017. The beaten-down greenback wasn’t expected to fare any better in 2018, as a rosy international growth outlook threatened to lure investors away from American markets. And despite some tough talk between the U.S. and China, risks of an all-out trade war were an afterthought.Not much has gone according to plan, but DWS, Cantor Fitzgerald and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were among the few who bet against the trend and got it right. Federal Reserve rate hikes against a backdrop of sharply escalating trade tensions roiled markets in 2018, punishing U.S. stocks and causing risk-averse investors to flee developing nations. Meanwhile, the down-and-out dollar has gained against virtually all major currencies amid rising rates and buoyant U.S. growth.Here’s what those who called 2018 correctly expect in the new year:Stalling DollarStefanie Holtze-Jen, chief currency strategist at asset manager DWS, is among the vindicated.In February, after the dollar’s worst annual slide in 14 years, she called for the greenback to strengthen to $1.15 per euro by March 2019, from the prevailing level of about $1.23. The argument that the U.S.’s twin deficits would depress the dollar was over-hyped, according to Holtze-Jen, who saw extreme bearish positioning setting up a rebound.The dollar’s rally starting in mid-April proved her right -- inflicting pain on global investors. But Holtze-Jen doesn’t expect another strong year for the greenback. She sees the euro ending next year at $1.15 as slowing growth and European political woes weigh on the common currency, while the Fed approaches the end of its hiking cycle. Expectations for Fed rate increases have crumbled, with markets now pricing in less than a quarter-point of tightening in 2019.Most forecasters expect the euro-dollar pair to reach $1.20 by the end of 2019, according to a Bloomberg survey, from about $1.14 now.“The Fed has come back from autopilot,” said Holtze-Jen. “Their calls will be more data-dependent. That’s something that takes the needle lower on the dollar going forward.”U.S. Equities GloomWhen it comes to U.S. stocks, 2018’s bears are still skeptical. For months, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Peter Cecchini has forecast the S&P 500 to finish the year at 2,805, one of the more bearish projections among Wall Street’s strategists, and almost 7 percent above Friday’s close.A deceleration in U.S. growth, driven in part by higher funding costs on tighter financial conditions, and a frothy commercial and industrial loan market will create credit stress next year, according to Cecchini.“Our disposition towards equities has moved from buy-the-dip to sell-the-rally,” said Cecchini, Cantor’s chief global market strategist. “If I’m not constructive on the credit markets, then I won’t be constructive on the equity markets.”He has company in his pessimism. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, the biggest equity bear on Wall Street, forecast last month that the S&P 500 will end 2019 at 2,750, the same target he called for this year. As the fiscal boost from tax cuts wears off and global growth decelerates, Wilson expects a “material” deceleration in corporate profits.That’s at odds with what most strategists expect. The average prediction as of the end of November was for the S&P 500 to climb to 3,056 by the end of next year, according to 14 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg. It’s the most optimistic year-ahead call since 2009.Emerging CheerJordi Visser at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, who predicted the peak of the developing-market rally in late January, expects emerging markets to be a bright spot in 2019 as the dollar stumbles. Visser is calling for the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) to outperform the S&P 500 Index by 15 percent to 20 percent in 2019. Chinese Internet stocks, developing-nation sovereign debt and emerging-market currencies look particularly attractive.""Bullishness comes from an expectation of a weaker dollar next year on the back of easier U.S. monetary policy, the lag of recent Chinese stimulus measures and a focus of value as a factor in 2019 rather than growth,"" said New-York based Visser, chief investment officer at the $1.7 billion hedge fund.Tania Escobedo, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC who correctly called a slide in the Brazilian real this year when most of the market was bullish, now has another contrarian call for 2019. She’s wagering against the real and going long the Mexican peso. Most investors are optimistic about Brazil’s incoming government and concerned about the populist rhetoric from Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.There are “pockets of value” in emerging markets, including Argentina’s beaten-down currency, Lisa Chua, a New York-based money manager at Man GLG, said in an interview last month. The firm boasted this year’s top developing-nation debt fund with more than $1 billion under management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Trade ReminderA year ago, Jens Nordvig at Exante Data LLC was cautioning that the markets weren’t adequately priced for a building U.S.-China trade dispute, as concern about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program garnered more attention. Now he expects trade tensions will remain a focal point in 2019, even after the world’s two biggest economies appear to have reached a tentative truce on tariffs.“China will try to delay and delay, but not give in on the big stuff,” said Nordvig, Wall Street’s top-ranked currency strategist for five years running before founding Exante. “By the second quarter, the U.S. will have to decide if they agree to some cosmetic concessions, or whether they are actually ready for a sustained trade war.”"

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators on Thursday said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) should stop working with delivery contractors that violate labor laws by imposing unfair conditions on drivers delivering packages for the e-commerce company.The senators, in a letter https:// to Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, responded to reports that alleged Amazon pressured contractors and more broadly avoided regulatory scrutiny. Amazon said in a statement it had taken steps to ensure ""a strong safety and labor compliance record across our transportation network of employees and contractors, and we continue to drive improvements that benefit our transportation providers, our customers and the public.""The company added it has ""strict requirements for safety and labor wages and working conditions that meet or exceed the law. We also require comprehensive insurance, competitive wages, working hours and numerous other safeguards for our delivery service providers and regularly audit to ensure compliance.""The letter was signed by Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown.Buzzfeed on Aug. 31 said Amazon was creating what it called exploitative conditions for driver contractors by pushing them to deliver upwards of 250 packages a day.Amazon had told Buzzfeed it expects its delivery operators to comply with labor laws.Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang had last week also called for increased regulation of Amazon's delivery network.

"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. investors looking to get into the volatile Chinese stock market without the cross-border hassle can find a slice of the action in their own backyards.A slew of Chinese technology companies listed in the U.S. via American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, have taken shareholders on a roller-coaster ride in the past few days. They include Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed NIO Inc., which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as well as Pinduoduo Inc., HUYA Inc., and 58.com Inc.NIO, the electric car-maker that’s accrued $1.6 billion in losses since the start of 2016, jumped 85 percent in two days after its $1 billion initial public offering. NIO Chief Financial Officer Louis Hsieh on Wednesday blamed the low initial price on bad timing, with recent losses in Asian markets making domestic investors “too jittery” to buy.Just a day after the interview, NIO’s shares surged 76 percent -- leading gains across other U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies. Pinduoduo, the e-commerce platform operator, jumped as much as 32 percent Thursday. The stock is up 58 percent since its July debut. ADRs from iQIYI Inc. jumped 6 percent on Thursday while 58.com closed up 9.3 percent.The list might grow longer as Qutoutiao Inc. -- the Chinese news and video aggregation app that’s also backed by Tencent -- is scheduled to begin trading after an expected IPO pricing this week in the $7 to $9 range.“Shares are gaining likely because overnight gains in NIO shares rekindled investors’ interest in new energy vehicles and the broad auto sector,” said Tian Yang, Hong Kong-based analyst with China Securities International. “That has helped sentiment and we don’t see any change in sector fundamentals.”The biggest China tech ADR of them all, however, has made little headway this year.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is down 4 percent in 2018, with Jack Ma detailing his plans this week to hand over his executive chairman role to CEO Daniel Zhang next year."

The claim is for damages of 155 billion reais ($27.4 billion). "
"By Sujata RaoLONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed half a percent on Monday, attempting to brush off fresh rises in global bond yields while equity futures also pointed to a firmer session on Wall Street which suffered its worst week in two years.A higher Friday close for New York stocks following a week of ""vol"" induced selling, lifted markets in Asia and Europe, helping MSCI's all-country index rise off four-month lows, while European shares firmed 1.4 percent after touching six-month troughs last week. Wall Street's equity volatility gauge, the VIX - the spike in which had kicked off the ructions - was at 26.5 percent, easing off Friday's 29 percent close.While the index had rocketed to 50 at the height of last week's turmoil, current levels are well above the long-term average around 11 percent, in a sign that investors' nerves are still jangling.The continued move-up in bond yields is reinforcing the fear of more volatility ahead. Ten-year Treasury yields hit new four-year highs around 2.90 percent, while German yields, the benchmark for Europe, hovered just below 0.8 percent, the 2-1/2-year high touched last week.""People are nervous after the shock of the past week but it doesn't feel like there is a crisis around the corner. But never say never,"" said Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.Given solid world economic growth, Lewis said the falls were more likely a wobble than a full-blown correction to the nine-year long equity bull market as bond investors priced in an improved economic outlook.""Even at 2.90 percent, 10-year Treasury yields are still low,"" he added.U.S. equity futures rose 1 percent.Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed equity funds had cut long positions in S&P 500 futures, reducing exposure to a market which has fallen about 8 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. INFLATION, DOLLARWhile equity markets attempt to recover, the question is whether they can withstand another sharp move up in bond yields - something will be put to the test by economic data this week.In China, banks extended a record amount of new yuan loans in January, blowing past expectations, which is likely to support growth not only in China but underpin liquidity globally.Analysts forecast U.S. consumer price inflation, to be released on Wednesday, to have slowed to 1.9 percent in January from a year earlier, while the core measure is seen ticking down to 1.7 percent.Given it was fears of faster inflation - and more aggressive rate rises - that triggered the global rout in the first place, an above-forecast figure could well spark a fresh selloff in stocks and bonds.Central bankers have not exhibited much concern over the equity rout, indicating they intend to push on with plans to tighten monetary policy this year.On currency markets, traders had cut net short positions in the dollar last week, CFTC data showed, but speculators returned on Monday to short the dollar, pushing it 0.2 percent lower versus a basket of currencies. Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said the risk bounce was being countered by the steeper U.S. bond curve but the soft dollar showed the former currently had the upper hand.The gap between short- and long-dated U.S. yields is at the widest in more than three months - the so-called curve steepening which indicates higher inflation expectations and economic activity.""If a better risk mood just encourages 10-year Treasuries to spike up through 2.9 percent, it seems unlikely that we will see equities bounce too far and by the same token, it's too early to sell dollars,"" Societe Generale warned clients.The euro rose around 0.2 percent, after losing 1.8 percent last week, while the yen eased off five-month highs hit last week amid the flight to safe-havens.Sterling meanwhile inched higher, off last week's three-week lows but Britain's shaky economy and rocky Brexit process kept it fragile.Monday's more cheerful market mood also lifted commodities, with Brent crude futures rising two percent after last week's 9 percent fall, copper bouncing off two-month lows and gold up 0.2 percent, well off five-week troughs.

"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit soared 200% due to surging demand for its  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) games console, and that title Animal Crossing: New Horizons shifted a record 13.4 million units in its first six weeks.The Kyoto-based gaming company posted operating profit of 89.4 billion yen for January-March, Reuters' calculations showed based on annual figures, smashing analyst estimates.Nintendo has defied scepticism over its ability to draw in consumers beyond a hardcore base in the Switch's fourth year with the runaway success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has become the console's fastest-selling title since launching on March 20.The appeal of the title among consumers looking for escapism in coronavirus-hit economies around the world underscores Nintendo's games-maker credentials at a time when investors have been frustrated by the company's conservative management, which includes what many regard as a half-baked foray into mobile gaming.Nintendo said it expects to sell 19 million Switch console units in the current financial year. Its forecasts are widely viewed as conservative.""Animal Crossing's impact was bigger than expected but is temporary,"" CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said, adding he did not see the company's forecasts, which include a fall in full year software sales to 140 million units, as conservative.In the year ended March, Nintendo sold 21 million Switch consoles, well above its forecast of 19.5 million.That breaks down as 14.8 million units of the hybrid home-portable device and 6.2 million units of the handheld-only Switch Lite, which went on sale in September.SHORTAGES The popularity of the device and the coronavirus outbreak's impact on supply chains has led to Switch shortages around the world, preventing the company from taking full advantage of pent-up demand.The company said production and shipping are ""gradually recovering"" following pandemic-induced delays but pointed to the risk of further disruption including to games development. ""It is difficult to expect the same productivity"" from employees working at home, Furukawa said, adding delays to game releases are a possibility if the crisis is protracted. Nintendo has provided few details of upcoming titles, risking putting a break on sales momentum as studios across the world scramble to mitigate disruption from the virus. Rival Sony Corp (T:6758) has already announced delays to high-profile releases. "
"Investing.com - Hong Kong-listed tech giant Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) is planning to roll out the “Call of Duty Mobile” to the U.S., Europe and Latin American markets, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.Call of Duty is a first-person shooter title and is one of the best-selling game franchises of all time, Bloomberg said. Tencent’s mobile version is currently in beta-testing and does not have a set-date for a full public roll-out.The article added that Tencent is adapting popular titles for mobile and exporting them to overseas amid slowing growth and regulatory clampdowns in China.It was reported previously that the Chinese government is banning violent content online and restricted screen time for youngsters.Citing Vincent Gao, the overseas marketing director for the Tencent’s Timi Studio Group, the article said the company will hire more developers abroad to tap the overseas market.“We’ve accumulated a lot of experience from developing mobile games in the past, and we think we have a pretty good chance of exporting our know-how,” Gao said in an interview. “In the future, we plan to introduce more categories with top-tier game developers.”"

"Just as the Federal Reserve is thought to use policy to protect equity markets, Saudi Arabia tries to manage crude oil prices by manipulating its production levels writes Phil Flynn of The PRICE Futures Group.You have heard about the so-called Fed put. That is a term that means the Federal Reserve has the markets back. If the markets or economy start to falter, the Fed’s plunge protection team will get into gear and adjust monetary policy to create a floor for the market. That in turn gives investors confidence to take on more risk because, even if the market gets weak, the Fed won’t allow it to crash.With the recent rebound in crude oil, traders are now talking about the Saudi put. That is that Saudi Arabia will not allow oil prices to fall and if it does, they will cut production accordingly. In fact, the Saudi announcement that they want $80 a barrel for crude, and that they will reduce their exports by 800,000 barrels-per-day is sending a signal to the market that the worst for oil may be over.Of course, Saudi Arabia’s power to manipulate the price of crude oil has diminished some in the age of shale, and it helps that the global stock markets are showing more optimism. So called progress on the U.S.-China trade discussions is bringing the risk appetite back into the marketplace and cumulative measures talked about in Asia to boost their economy is changing the pessimism about overall energy demand. A senior Chinese official said China plans to introduce policies to boost domestic spending on items such as autos and home appliances this year. This comes after China lowered their reserve requirement for bank lending that, along with more stimuli should raise oil demand expectations.This comes as the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan. 4, according to sources. This massive drop in supply is showing that previous cuts by the Saudis are already showing up and this could be the beginning of a massive drain on U.S. oil supplies.Of course, that is looking forward. In the short term, the big drop in crude was offset by mindboggling builds in products. The API reported that gasoline stockpiles surged by an astounding 5.5 million barrels, while distillate inventories rocketed by 10.2 million barrels. The post market reaction seemed to shrug off the product build and focus more on the crude draw.U.S. shale operators are still in pullback mode and with the OPEC cuts about to drain our supplies; the bottom in oil looks solid. Of course, if we see a reversal or panic in stocks that could change, but for now the new oil uptrend will be your friend.Yet despite the price drop in the big picture, energy supply prospects for the future continue to brighten. Reuters reported that  BP  (LON:BP) struck black gold discovering two new oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico that could bring an additional billion barrels of oil at an existing field, thanks to new seismic technology.Reuters writes: “The company has put a heavy emphasis on technology and data processing capabilities in recent years in order to unlock new resources and cut costs. The $1.3 billion Atlantis Phase 3 development will include drilling eight wells and a new subsea production system that will boost BP’s production by 38,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day. It is scheduled to start production in 2020. Together with the new discoveries, BP aims to grow its Gulf of Mexico production from over 300,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day at present to 400,000 by the mid-2020s. BP said that new seismic technology helped it identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil at its Thunder Horse field within weeks, whereas previously it would have taken a year to analyze.”Remember peak oil and you can’t drill your way to energy independence? Neither do I.Hellenic Shipping News reports that the middle distillates complex in Asia rolled out 2019 on diverging paths. While the gasoil market has made a strong comeback since plummeting to its lowest level on Dec. 21, co-distillate jet fuel continued to remain sluggish. Market sources said that this trend was likely to continue for the rest of the month, citing diverging fundamentals between the two products.Despite the Asian gasoil market kicking off the year on a steady footing, some traders cautioned that looking forward; the middle distillate might be on track for a sustained recovery from here. Some traders hold a more bullish sentiment for the Asian gasoil market in the near term, pointing out that volumes flowing out of the region have helped to ease the overhang in supply. “For January, Asia exported over 1 million mt of gasoil out of the region,” a trader said, adding that gasoil might see an overall improvement in fundamentals.Conversely, the Asian jet fuel/kerosene spot market started the year on a weaker footing, as a glut of surplus cargoes pressured cash differentials deeper into discount territory. While demand has been steady amid the ongoing winter season, market participants continued to point to a ready availability of cargoes from South Korea and China."
"By Rajendra JadhavMUMBAI (Reuters) - India arrested the head of a bankrupt realty company on Thursday after lender Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) accused executives of partaking in a ""criminal conspiracy"" involving forged audit reports that cost the bank some 43.55 billion rupees ($616.5 million).In the latest case to roil India's banking sector, PMC made a police complaint accusing its own executives and officials at Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) of misleading the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 2008 to August 2019 by forging the audits to hide the fact that big accounts had become non-performing assets.The RBI last week took charge of the bank and suspended Managing Director Joy Thomas and the bank's board after uncovering lending irregularities. PMC has been barred from renewing, or granting any loans, or making investments without the RBI's prior approval.Depositors have been informed they can only withdraw a maximum of 10,000 rupees ($140) from their PMC accounts over the next six months. On Tuesday, dozens of account holders gathered outside an RBI office in Mumbai to protest against the curbs and demand that the central bank and government intervene to release their funds.On Thursday evening, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police arrested HDIL's chairman Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan as well as his son Sarang Wadhawan, the bank's vice chairman, Mumbai Police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok told Reuters. He declined to provide information about the charges against them.Reuters was not immediately able to contact the two Wadhawans. HDIL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the past two years, India's troubled banking sector has been rocked by a multibillion-dollar fraud at a state-run lender, the collapse of a major infrastructure lender, bad loan issues at state-run banks and a liquidity squeeze that has hit shadow lenders.Indian media outlets on Sunday reported that PMC's exposure to HDIL stood at 65 billion rupees, which accounts for 73% of its overall 88.8 billion loan book. That is well above the RBI's permissible exposure levels to a single entity.PMC could not immediately be reached for comment on the estimate.More than two dozen co-operative banks are now under RBI administration. PMC, among the top five co-operative banks in the country with deposits of 116.2 billion rupees as of March 31, is by far the largest.India has more than 1,500 small urban co-operative banks that typically service small local communities in certain districts or states. Depositors at co-operative banks are in a relatively higher risk zone, but tens of thousands still bank with these lenders as they typically offer better interest rates on deposits."

The Johannesburg-based miner’s shares have risen 104% in the past 12 months.While rivals such as Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Lonmin Plc are also benefiting from higher prices for palladium and rhodium, which they dig up alongside platinum, Amplats is in a particularly strong position. The company resumed dividends last February after a six-year hiatus, during which it sold and wound down older, less profitable operations.Palladium has surged 47 percent to successive records since the end of August. Demand for the metal, used primarily in the auto industry for catalytic converters in gasoline engines, is projected to exceed supply for an eighth straight year in 2019. The South African currency has also weakened 18 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, which lowers costs at local mines.Amplats said it expects the three major platinum-group metals -- platinum, palladium and rhodium -- will again be in a combined deficit in 2019, although platinum itself will see a “modest” surplus. Palladium will be in a “strong and widening” deficit this year, the company said.“Automotive demand seems set to increase, even with little or no growth in vehicle sales, as average vehicle size increases and emissions rules tighten,” it said.Amplats rose as much as 2.6 percent on Monday to 708.89 rand a share, the highest since February 2011.The company’s strong balance sheet will enable it to increase investment in projects with low capital requirements and fast payback, while it advances studies to boost output at its key Mogalakwena mine that’s highly geared toward palladium, Ian Botha, the outgoing finance director, said on a conference call.Amplats plans to complete studies by about 2020 to add annual output of 270,000 ounces of palladium and 250,000 ounces of platinum at Mogalakwena, Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said. The expansion may take about four to five years, he said.Meanwhile, Amplats expects the palladium deficit to persist until there’s a meaningful move by auto makers to substitute platinum in their designs, the CEO said."
"By Jörn Poltz and Arno SchuetzeMUNICH (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, who is being investigated over his role in Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) emissions test cheating scandal.Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel. The affair has so far cost the German carmaker 30 billion euros ($33.5 billion).The public prosecutor's office in Munich said Stadler and three other defendants are being charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Stadler has denied any wrongdoing, his lawyer said.Premium brand Audi only admitted in November 2015 that its 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device which was deemed illegal in the United States.Volkswagen and its former managers have faced numerous law suits, and in April prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig charged former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud over his role.The Munich prosecutor said that three of the defendants are accused of having developed engines for Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche cars that used emissions cheat devices. ""Defendant Stadler is accused of having been aware of the manipulations since the end of September 2015 at the latest, but he did not prevent the sale of affected Audi and VW vehicles thereafter,"" the prosecutor said in a statement.Stadler was arrested in June 2018 as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, which is part of Volkswagen Group, and spent several months in prison.Volkswagen later terminated Stadler's contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions tests cheating. The prosecutors said that his indictment relates to roughly 250,000 Audi branded cars, 112,000 Porsches and 72,000 Volkswagen cars that were sold in the U.S. and Europe.'PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE' The defendants charged by the Munich prosecutor include former Audi and Porsche manager Wolfgang Hatz as well as two engineers, several people familiar with the proceedings said.Hatz, former research and development chief at Porsche and former head of powertrain development at Audi and parent Volkswagen, spent several months in custody in 2017 and 2018 over his alleged role in the emissions cheating scandal. A lawyer for Hatz separately said his client denied any wrongdoing.The Munich prosecutors on Wednesday declined to identify the defendants, except for Stadler.Investigations against 23 further suspects continue, the prosecutor's office said. The Braunschweig prosecutors had said that Volkswagen's emissions cheating took place between November 2006 and September 2015, and that Winterkorn failed in his duty to inform European and U.S. authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated. Winterkorn had also neglected to inform customers of, and did not prevent, the continued installation of fraudulent software, the prosecutors have said.Winterkorn's lawyer has said he cannot comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.Audi said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in the interest of the company, its shareholders and employees to clarify the issues that led to the diesel crisis.""Until this has happened, the presumption of innocence must prevail,"" the spokesman said.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis's shift into high-tech drugs won praise for providing patients with new options but criticism over prices that may run into the millions of dollars at the Swiss drugmaker's annual general meeting on Thursday. Shareholders at the event in Basel also approved Novartis's planned spin-off of its Alcon eyecare unit, due for coming months, with investors with five Novartis shares due to receive one share of Alcon stock.Swiss shareholder group Actares said insurance systems are being ""taken hostage"" by high prices for life-saving drugs. It called out Novartis's $475,000 cancer cell therapy Kymriah and its still-unapproved gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy that Novartis contends is cost-effective at $4-$5 million per patient, while independent groups have concluded its value is less than that.Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who did not testify this week before the U.S. Senate with other global drug industry executives also facing criticism for drug prices, said he seeks to price medicines based on their value, adding Novartis needs a fair return to further research and development.""With respect to pricing in cell and gene therapies, I think what's often lost in the discussion is the remarkable impact of these medicines,"" Narasimhan said. ""These are true breakthroughs that come from a single infusion of a medicine that don't require lifelong therapy.""Actares President Veronika Hendry said high drug prices present society with difficult questions over access. ""With this business model you are taking hostage an insurance system that depends on solidarity,"" Hendry said. ""There's currently a broad discussion going on over exorbitant drug prices, and this discussion is creating resentment and disbelief."" "
"MILAN (Reuters) - Hitachi (T:6501) has wrapped up a bitter feud with U.S. activist investor Elliott over  Ansaldo STS  (MI:STS), agreeing to buy the fund's stake in the Italian rail signaling group as part of a move to take full control.The Japanese conglomerate could spend as much as 1.25 billion euros to become the sole owner of Ansaldo STS, which it said would have a leading role to play in growing its rail business, including through acquisitions. Hitachi and investment funds led by Elliott have been rowing since the Japanese company took a majority stake in Ansaldo STS in 2015, with Elliott - which holds a minority stake - complaining about the price paid by Hitachi as well as Ansaldo's strategy and governance.Under the deal announced on Monday, Hitachi will pay a premium of 9.5 percent to buy Elliott's 31.79 percent stake in Ansaldo STS, costing it around 807.6 million euros ($920 million). It will then launch a bid for the rest of Italian company with the aim of delisting it.Hitachi will buy Elliott's shares in Ansaldo STS at 12.70 euros. The mandatory bid on residual shares will then be launched at the same price.Ansaldo STS shares rose more than 9 percent to a session high of 12.68 euros, matching the offer price.Owned by U.S. hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Elliott is an outspoken investor in many European and U.S. companies. In 2015 Elliott refused to sell its Ansaldo STS shares to Hitachi in a previous public offer on the Italian company, judging the 9.50 euro per share price offered then too low.The railway industry was shaken last year when  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) announced a plan to merge their rail units into a Franco-German champion to stave off competition from bigger Chinese rival China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation and Canada's Bombardier Transportation.($1 = 0.8776 euros) "

"By Stine JacobsenCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk's (CO:MAERSKb) is betting on winning new customers for its port division by becoming a one-stop shop that can transport goods from factory to retailers' shelves.The move comes as Maersk, the world's biggest container shipper, is entering uncharted territory following its sale last year of most of its energy businesses. This marked a major shift of focus for the group towards transport and logistics.Last month, Maersk said it aimed to expand its port and transport services, giving customers the chance to deal with one company when shipping goods from factory to shop shelf.Maersk has said it aims to become a global integrator of container logistics and is looking to models similar to the courier express and package industry, where customers deal with just one company such as UPS (N:UPS) or FedEx (N:FDX). But Maersk has no plans to enter the courier and package business.As part of the expansion, APM Terminals, the group's port division, which operates 74 port facilities and handled nearly 40 million containers last year, will expand onshore services to cater to companies like railway operators and freight haulers. ""If we're going to optimise Maersk's entire end-to-end supply chain then of course we need to optimise one of the points that could otherwise be a bottleneck and that's the port,"" APM Terminal's chief commercial officer Henrik Lundgaard Pedersen said in an interview.Pedersen said customers were increasingly asking for add-on services at the port terminals, which are the effective ""nerve centre"" for transporting cargo around the world.He said customers' were looking to deal with ""fewer business partners to do the same or more types of services.""The new services include streamlining the process of weighing, stripping and filling the shipping containers and improving trucker appointment systems for delivery and pick-up.""In some parts of the world, truckers can wait hours outside our terminals,"" Pedersen said. The planning to reduce waiting time is becoming ""very, very critical,"" he said. As part of the plans, APM Terminals has set up landside facilities within customers' premises in Peru and Chile so it can take charge of a cargo before it even leaves the mine or plantation.""We go all the way into where they grow the grapes, then we help them get them into the right container and all the way through the port to your dining table,"" Pedersen said.In Mexico, for example, APM Terminals organizes train transport from the Pacific Coast to premises close to Mexico City.Maersk captured synergies worth $100 million last year from integrating its transport and logistics business and targets total synergies of $600 million by 2019.Pedersen declined to give details on what investments were expected, but said capital expenditure for handling equipment was ""much less"" than when taking cargo from ship to shore.APM Terminals is the second-biggest division after Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipper, and it accounted for around 13 percent of revenue last year.

"(Bloomberg) -- French and Italian leaders have reveled in throwing mud at each other, but two of the countries’ flagship companies are now looking beyond the bad blood to cozy up to each other.The prospective deal, a proposal by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) to merge with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), could create the world’s third-biggest carmaker. The prospect is already triggering contrasting responses from politicians, though the Italian company has said there won’t be plant closures as a result of the combination.On hearing news of the tie-up, the rightist League party of Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, who has in the past clashed virulently with French President Emmanuel Macron, swiftly invoked Italy’s “national interest” and dangled the option of the Rome government stepping in. The League, after all, campaigned for Sunday’s European Parliament election on an “Italy First” platform.“Given the state presence in Renault, the fact that two companies of this size plan to merge has to be looked at with special care,” the League’s Claudio Borghi, who heads the lower house budget committee, told La7 television. Borghi was quick to remind viewers that the French government fought tooth-and-nail against a bid by Italy’s Fincantieri for the France-based STX shipyard.Italy will ensure “that the historic value of Fiat is guaranteed, otherwise we’ll intervene,” Borghi said, adding that could include the state taking a stake in Fiat to match the French holding in Renault.Debt MountainA French government official said it would be surprising if the founding Agnelli family welcomed a state presence in the company. The official, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters, also wondered aloud whether the Italian government -- already burdened with a mountain of debt -- would have the funds to pay for it.Still, the official could not see any political risks to the merger, and insisted it would be a win-win for the two countries and their economies.The merger will promote European “economic sovereignty,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told BFM TV, adding the government favors the link-up, though it’s waiting to examine all the conditions.With the League surging to become Italy’s biggest political force in Sunday’s European elections, Salvini could be more tempted than ever to fly the nationalist flag and take a provocative stand on the merger, especially if jobs are at risk.“We welcome the FCA-Renault deal, as long as factories in Italy stay open,” the League’s Massimo Garavaglia, deputy finance minister, told Radio 24. “The market is always right.”Recent cross-border transactions have inflamed nationalism in both countries.  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA’s two biggest shareholders, French media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA and U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp., have been locked in a battle for influence at the carrier for more than a year.Salvini has taken particular pleasure in launching folksy broadsides against Macron, last year calling him “a polite young man who drinks too much champagne.” Salvini has also accused Macron of protecting fugitives wanted by Italian authorities, including convicted members of the far-left Red Brigades.Macron, who has spoken of “populist leprosy,” retorted that Italians “deserve a government worthy of their history.”The sparring between the two neighbors has quieted down from its low point, when France recalled its ambassador for a week in February, although Salvini repeatedly took aim at Macron in the European election campaign, calling the French leader a symbol of the liberal, establishment class he pledged to overthrow."
"By David Henry and Inti LandauroNEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Sunday that it has selected impoverished areas around Paris as the first foreign focus of an urban economic development strategy it started four years ago in Detroit.The bank will contribute $30 million over five years to programs to teach job skills and expand small businesses in Seine-Saint-Denis and other places with high unemployment and poverty, JPMorgan said in a statement provided to Reuters.Located north of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis has the highest poverty and crime rates in France. Dotted with large social housing projects, the area is separated from wealthy Paris only by an extremely congested highway circling the city. The area was in the center of the riots that devastated suburbs all over France a decade ago.CEO Jamie Dimon planned to follow the announcement with a visit to the city on Tuesday. Dimon has been leaving more day-to-day operations of the New York-based bank to lieutenants while he promotes policies and public-private partnerships which he believes will promote economic growth.His advocacy work has been primarily in the United States where JPMorgan earns about 80 percent of its revenue.The Paris effort is part of JPMorgan's ""Advancing Cities"" program, which builds on investments of $150 million in Detroit and $40 million in Chicago, cities where JPMorgan has the biggest market share of bank deposits.JPMorgan executives have said they want more business abroad, particularly commercial lending to mid-sized companies.JPMorgan employs about 200 people in France among some 255,000 worldwide.JPMorgan employees in Paris work in investment banking, money management and capital markets. They do not serve low-income individuals or small businesses who could be the first to benefit from the new effort.Peter Scher, JPMorgan Head of Corporate Responsibility, said the program will provide workers the skills needed by the bank's business clients, some of which are in office towers near areas where unemployment rates reach 35 percent.""That is a good bet for the economy and it is a good bet for our firm,"" said Scher.The job training will focus on the construction, information technology and environmental sustainability industries which are important in France, he said.The $30 million for Paris is part of $500 million JPMorgan said in September that it would spend in as many as 30 cities, including some outside of the United States.JPMorgan reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion."
"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Saikat ChatterjeeLONDON (Reuters) - A surge of interest in Italian bond futures may be a sign of a substantial short position building up in the derivatives market as tensions rise over budget negotiations between Rome and Brussels.The big short in the futures market reflects a buildup in speculative and hedging activity after a tumultuous summer in the Italian markets and also indicates rising concerns of capital outflows.Investors say it also leaves the market potentially open to a sharp rebound if the debt story improves in some way over the coming months either through a breakthrough in negotiations over the debt dynamics or approval from credit rating agencies.As Italy's anti-establishment government attempts to pass an expansionary budget in the face of opposition from the European Union, investors are ramping up their use of a product that is increasingly being used to take bets that more losses are in store for the country's bonds.Italy has the biggest outstanding bond market in the euro zone and futures trading has rocketed in recent months as hedge funds have stepped up their presence, even as the underlying cash bond markets have shown signs of stress during extreme episodes of volatility.Average daily turnover so far this year for short-term BTP futures contracts have surged 40 percent to nearly 70,000 contracts compared to 2017 while longer-term BTP futures have also grown substantially, according to futures exchange, Eurex.The rise in turnover has also been accompanied by surging yields and growing open interest or the amount of positions left outstanding, indicating speculators are comfortable in taking outright short bets, according to market players.For example, open interest on short-dated BTP futures <0#FBTS:> peaked at a record 280,000 contracts on Oct. 25 and has consistently averaged around 275,000 contracts in the last two weeks.""Clearly today there are a number of investors, including large hedge fund investors who are taking large short positions on Italian debt through both the short and long-dated BTP futures,"" said Mark Dowding, head of developed markets at BlueBay Asset Management.In contrast to the growing popularity of bond futures, turnover in credit default swaps has declined as the increased scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the euro zone crisis dimmed its allure for taking speculative bets.For example, net outstanding dollar value of credit default swaps (CDS) contracts on Italy has declined by more than a quarter to less than $12 billion in the week ending November 6, compared to the beginning of 2017, according to data from post-trade provider Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.""In a world where investors can't take naked short positions by buying sovereign CDS, Italian futures are the instrument to use if you want to implement a short view,"" Dowding added. GRAPHIC: Spike in open interest in 2-yr BTP Futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P2MCh1TAKING BETSA portfolio manager at a macro-hedge fund in London said he uses futures to take bets on Italian debt because the margining system in futures contracts makes it less capital intensive than purchasing bonds.Margining refers to the practice in futures markets, wherein investors have to cough up only a chunk of the notional value contract, allowing them to take bigger positions. In cash or CDS trading, on the other hand, traders have to put up the entire amount in order to take a view.Despite more capital needed to trade credit default swaps compared to futures, these derivatives, designed to protect against the risk of debt default, were widely used by investors looking to hedge the possibility of sovereign default, especially in Greece, during the 2010-2012 debt crisis.CDS were used also to take directional bets on a market, sometimes even when the investor did not own the bond prompting regulators to bring in rules banning ""naked"" CDS trading -- purchasing CDS contracts in a purely speculative manner without having exposure to the underlying asset.The increased scrutiny on CDS trading by regulators fueled appetite for trading bond futures as investors welcomed their transparent settlement mechanisms and liquidity, particularly during times of market stress. So this year, when a severe Italian bond selloff kicked off in May, futures trading exploded where open interest has increased every month barring May, June and September this year. Seamus MacGorain, a fixed income portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, said futures trading activity also tends to spike during periods of volatility because that is usually accompanied by across-the-board liquidity declines.Decline in liquidity is evident from widening bid-offer spreads -- the difference between prices what investors pay to execute a trade with wider spreads indicating falling liquidity.In September for instance, monthly weighted average bid-offer spreads on five-year bonds stood at a chunky 13 basis points, the Italian Treasury's website says.Those spreads were a fraction in the futures markets, according to a bond trader. ""Italian bond market liquidity fell during summer's market volatility, and continues to be impaired,"" MacGorain said.GRAPHIC: Italian bond yield - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qw6pSy "
"Investing.com – Asian stocks took a cue from the major indices in the U.S. and turned negative on Tuesday morning, although the losses in Asia were generally subdued.Overnight Monday, shares plunged in U.S. markets giving up early gains with markets reacting to the lack of details around any potential trade deal between the U.S. and China and the potential of any deal having limited impact on global growth.Chinese shares took a breather on Tuesday morning.The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.36% by 9:25 AM ET (2:25 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component offered an exception to the downbeat performances by rising 0.53%. Chinese shares have enjoyed significant gains this year. The Shanghai Composite is up around 18% from the beginning of 2019 and Shenzhen is up about 25%.In Hong Kong Tuesday morning, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.55% at mid-morning to 28,797.Most other major stock markets around the region were also in the red.Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.62% to 21,676 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 0.71% to 2,175. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.37% to 6,196.The losses on Tuesday marked a significant turn-around in the mood of investors who, on Monday, had powered indexes to substantial gains on expectations of a quick trade deal between China and the U.S. While those expectations remain, few details of any agreement have come to light.At the same time, China’s National People’s Congress opened its annual meeting on Tuesday. Policy makers have lowered the target for economic growth in the country to between 6% and 6.5% for this year. The target “band” rather than a specific target gives regulators more room to maneuver.“It’s good news for the market in the short term; bad news for China is the medium term as more leverage will need to be piled up,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA, told Bloomberg.Regulators also announced cuts to the value-added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing. The tax could add up to as much as CNY800 billion, according to figures from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) quoted by Bloomberg."
"By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Agamoni Ghosh(Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, on track for their best day in more than a week, as a surprise bounce in China's manufacturing activity overshadowed conflicting tones surrounding a possible trade deal between the United States and China.The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.3% at 0915 GMT, with China-exposed German shares (GDAXI) up 0.4%, while mining stocks (SXPP) led gains among sub-sectors following upbeat data from the world's top metals consumer.China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in October as new export orders rose and plants ramped up production, a private business survey showed on Friday.""The numbers are good given it came ahead of expectations and expansion is always a welcome,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC markets in London.The latest data is in contrast to an official survey published on Thursday, which showed China's factory activity shrank for the sixth straight month in October.""The Caixin numbers do seem to be more impartial than official numbers from Beijing, so it is a welcome change, although U.S.-China trade is going to be the main focus for now.""Conflicting signals on trade gave investors reason for caution after a Bloomberg report said Chinese officials have doubts about whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with Washington and U.S. President Donald Trump.But Trump later said the two countries would soon announce a site where a ""Phase One"" trade deal will be signed after Chile canceled a planned summit set for mid-November that was to be the venue for a signing.After a volatile week packed with corporate news and conflicting tones on the trade front, the benchmark index was on track to end the week slightly higher.Danish stocks (OMXC20) outperformed their European peers, boosted by transport and logistics services company DSV Panalpina (CO:DSV), which gained 8% after reporting strong third-quarter results despite challenging conditions in the freight market.Drugmaker  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) rose 1.5% after raising its sales outlook for 2019 on the back of its new drugs for type II diabetes and obesity.BANKS LAGDenmark's biggest lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) slid 4% after narrowing its annual profit outlook as the tainted Scandinavian lender grapples to restore trust after being involved in one of the world's biggest money laundering scandals.That pulled the banking sector (SX7P) lower and on track for a 3.6% weekly loss after sour results from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) earlier in the week.Investors now look forward to U.S. non-farm payrolls data later in the day to gauge how the trade dispute is impacting the world's largest economy."

"Investing.com -- Shares in Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) fell in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday after the cloud security company backed a conservative full-year billings outlook that overshadowed better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results.Calculated billings for the California-based firm's 2024 financial year were reaffirmed at a range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion, disappointing Bloomberg consensus projections of $2.55B at the midpoint.Observers had hoped that Zscaler's decision to raise its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $2.45 to $2.48 from a prior outlook of $2.20 to $2.25 would also translate to an improved billings guidance, analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients.Speaking to analysts in a call, Zscaler Chief Financial Officer Remo Canessa flagged that the global operating environment remains ""challenging,"" adding that customers are ""continu[ing] to scrutinize large deals."" However, consumer sentiment ""seems to be stabilizing,"" according to Canessa.""In our outlook for fiscal [year 2024], we are balancing our business optimism and continued sales execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties,"" he said.Executives at Zscaler noted that the fresh appointment of a go-to-market leadership team that aims to ""scale and accelerate"" the company's next phase of expansion was also cited as a motive for the muted billings estimate.In Zscaler's first quarter, calculated billings grew 34% year-over-year to $456.6M, although that was slower than a 37% increase seen in the prior three-month period. Meanwhile, for the quarter ended on Oct. 31, Zscaler reported adjusted per-share income of $0.67 on revenue of $496.7M. The figures topped estimates despite an almost 24% jump in quarterly operating expenses to $431.4M, which reflected a push to roll out new services to satisfy surging demand for cyber security and artificial intelligence offerings.“In order to meet this growing need, we are scaling our go-to-market and [research and development] organizations, strengthening our foundation for the long-term growth of our business,” said Chief Executive Officer Jay Chaudhry in a statement.Yasin Ebrahim contributed to this report."
"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Tuesday, as a plunge in oil prices weighed on investor sentiment, even as Congress readies a $500 billion coronavirus aid package to further support the economy.  The Dow fell 2.67%, or 631 points, theS&P 500 slipped 3,07% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.48%.Worries over a storage squeeze amid a collapsed in fuel demand sent oil prices sharply lower for the second day in a row.""The EIA reported in October that storage capacity was around 426.5 (million barrels) and was 55% full. Using inventory since then, we calculate that capacity utilization has risen to over 81%,"" ANZ Research said in a note.The plunge in energy prices was exacerbated after Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees oil and gas companies, delayed a vote on mandated production cuts demanded by midsized shale oil drillers.Despite the plunge in oil prices of more than 40%, energy stocks outperformed the broader market, ending the day down 1.4%.The selloff in oil stoked worries about loan defaults, pressuring regional banks, which typically carry a larger energy-lending portfolio than that of Wall Street banks.  The Settle KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index fell more than 2.5%.Tech stocks led the day of selling on Wall Street with FANG and chip stocks bearing the brunt.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 4.2%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 1.6% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down 3.08%, while Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended down about 0.77%.Also weighing on tech,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) fell 3% after the company pulled guidance and reported quarterly revenue that missed expectations due to the impact from the coronavirus pandemic.On the economic data front, the decline in existing home sales in March was not as bad as many had feared, but the data was largely shrugged off as it did not reflect the full extent of the lockdown measures, which began in mid-March.But the lockdown measures in some states are nearing an end, with Georgia and South Carolina set to lift lockdown restrictions this week.News that Congress reached a tentative agreement Tuesday with President Donald Trump on a nearly $500 billion coronavirus relief bill that would top up the $349 billion small business rescue program failed to lift sentiment. "
"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow1. Inflation on Watch as Analysts Say Rate Cuts Coming Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Tuesday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists forecast overall inflation measured by the consumer price index in July rose 0.3% from 0.1% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% from a 0.3% gain in June.That would bring year-over-year core CPI growth to 3.2% and core CPI growth unchanged at 2.1%.The Federal Reserve pointed to the subdued pace of consumer inflation as one of the key reasons for its rate cut last month, and further evidence of sluggish prices will strengthen calls for more aggressive rate cuts. UBS said it expected the Fed to deliver two further cuts, in September and in December this year, with another cut in March 2020, reducing rates to a range of 1% to 1.25%, well below the Fed's recent outlook on the longer-run fed funds rate of 2.5%Expectations for rate cuts as well as weakening global growth saw the Treasury curve flatten further on Monday, with the spread between the yields on the 10-year and 2-year Treasuries narrowing to levels not seen since 2007.2. API Crude Inventories, OPEC Monthly Report in Spotlight Following the Energy Information Administration's report last week of an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, investors will look to the American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data for further insight into domestic crude supplies. The report will arrive ahead of OPEC's monthly report, with investors keen to get a sense of the oil cartel's outlook on world demand and supply.The monthly report comes at a time when many fear a slowdown in the global economy could dent oil demand and pressure crude prices further. West Texas Intermediate crude is off about 17% from its late April peak of $66.30.Crude oil prices, however, shrugged off fears of a slowdown in global growth on Monday, settling at $54.93 a barrel, up 0.8%, supported by reports that OPEC, in particular Saudi Arabia, is eyeing further production cuts. 3. JD.com, Tilray Earnings on DeckJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the opening bell, with shares up about 29% so far this year. The company's efforts to increase its e-commerce footprint in emerging markets is expected to continue underpin top-line growth. The company previously guided second-quarter revenue in the range of RMB145 billion and RMB150 billion, representing growth of 19% to 23% year on year.JD.com is expected to report earnings per share of RMB0.46 on RMB147.56 billion of revenue, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), meanwhile, kicks off earnings for marijuana stocks after the closing bell. Like some of its peers, Tilray's earnings have been characterized by surging revenue, but widening losses as the marijuana company continues to invest in expanding its production and manufacturing operations in Canada and Portugal. The marijuana producer's acquisition of Manitoba Harvest in February earlier is expected to boost recreational cannabis sales and hemp food sales. Tilray, down 40% for the year, is expected to report a loss of 26 cents a share on revenue of $40.35 million. "
"By Arunima Banerjee(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he was selling auto parts maker Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Inc (N:TEN) in a $5.4 billion deal, unloading an investment he has held for nearly two decades and picking up a new stake in Tenneco.Tenneco plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies - one focusing on powertrain products and the other on auto parts such as suspensions and axle dampers - after the deal closes.The new bulked up powertrain technology company will likely benefit from the fact that internal combustion engine parts and tailpipe exhaust scrubbing technology will be needed by automakers for a long time to come, before they can be replaced by newer technologies such as fully electric cars.The aftermarket parts company would provide a potentially steady cash flow.This is the latest in a series of corporate restructurings or spinoffs in the auto supplier industry, as investors press for more focused companies. See Breakingviews: B. Riley analyst Christopher Van Horn said the Federal-Mogul deal could drive expectations of more consolidation in the sector.Tenneco's shares rose 5.8 percent to $58.78, while Icahn Enterprises' (O:IEP) shares were up 2.7 percent at $61.29.""Going to market with well-recognized brands, more product categories, greater coverage and expanded distribution capabilities is a strong formula for capturing growth, particularly in China,"" Tenneco Executive Chairman Gregg Sherrill said on the call. Icahn Enterprises  will get $800 million cash and 29.5 million of Tenneco common shares in the deal.The equity value of the deal is $2.4 billion. Federal-Mogul, which makes powertrain parts including pistons, ignition coils and spark plugs, had gross debt of $3.1 billion.It was not clear if Icahn would hold stakes in the separate companies.He first bought convertible bonds in Federal-Mogul in 2001 for $1.1 billion, and finally took it private last year after buying the remaining 18 percent he did not already own.Icahn's firm Icahn Enterprises (O:IEP) typically buys undervalued assets, improves their operations, and ultimately sells them at a profit.""We expect to be meaningful stockholders of Tenneco going forward,"" Icahn said in a statement.The deal is expected to generate $200 million in annual earnings and $250 million in working capital.Lake Forest, Illinois-based Tenneco, whose customers include  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), would now also get  Cummins Inc  (N:CMI) and luxury carmaker Jaguar as clients. Barclays  (LON:BARC) was the lead financial adviser to Tenneco, while J.P.Morgan was the M&A adviser. "
"(Bloomberg) -- At this point, it’s more likely a matter of when -- not if -- the 10-year Treasury yield hits 3 percent. And that apparent inevitability raises a pressing question: How to trade when it happens?The 10-year yield was last above 3 percent in January 2014 and since the start of last year bond gurus like Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital and Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners have highlighted the level as critical to determining whether the three-decade bull market in bonds is at an end. It’s also seen as the point at which equity markets might crack and the dollar could halt its slump against other major currencies.The yield reached as high as 2.9537 percent on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting helped spur a selloff, and it was at 2.93 percent as of 7:45 a.m. Thursday in New York.Here’s what to watch for when the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reaches the much vaunted 3 percent level:Breakout or Pullback?The most immediate question for traders: Do 10-year yields hit 3 percent and retreat, or does positioning signal a sharp move higher? Anticipating the volatility and its implications could make a big difference.“Certainly as we get closer to 3 percent, people will get nervous,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “I would expect flows to pick up as we’re closer and closer to 3 and to see some choppiness in the market.”Volatility may not be as bad as some investors fear. So-called “short gamma” strategies, which effectively bet that the market will stay quiet, have been steadily hedging those wagers, according to a New York trader who isn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. That means an accelerated break through 3 percent may not happen.In fact, open interest on 10-year Treasury futures suggests 3 percent may not be the crucial level after all. There are a large number of March puts at a 120 strike price, equivalent to a 2.95 percent yield. That helps explain the resistance to moving much higher than that so far this year.Another large accumulation of puts comes at a 118 strike price in April, equivalent to a 3.1 percent yield on the 10-year security. Dealers who are on the other side of those options could hedge during a selloff by purchasing 10-year Treasury futures, thus creating inherent support.In other words, those bond bears ready to watch the Treasury market falter at 3 percent may be in for a slow grind.Testing TechnicalsTo be precise, traders will be watching for the 10-year yield to break through 3.0516 percent, the intraday high from Jan. 2, 2014. You have to go back to July 2011 to find the last time the yield exceeded that level.Technical analysis has its naysayers, but it’s been a harbinger of things to come since Donald Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential election. For all of 2017, the key 2.64 percent level on 10-year yields couldn’t be broken. Strategists warned that a breach left little stopping an ascent to 3 percent.Sure enough, yields soared past 2.64 percent in January and now they’re knocking on the door of 3 percent.The next stop (once 3 percent is convincingly in the rear-view mirror) is less clear. Beyond 3.05 percent, the next area of yield resistance would be around 3.14 percent or 3.15 percent, which relates to levels from late 2010 and early 2011, said Marty Mitchell, a former head government-bond trader at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and now an independent strategist. Further out, he points to 3.215 percent to 3.25 percent.In the distance, a big key level would be near the highs for 2011, Mitchell said. The yield reached as much as 3.77 percent in February of that year. Of course, that’s a ways away and, as the positioning data shows, it’ll be a struggle to take out each successive key level.“I think we test 3.05, then we see a more sustained correction downside in yields,” Mitchell said. “But I believe we’re in an uptrend in yields, so any strength in the bond market needs to be sold.”Watching StocksTreasuries, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s easy to forget amid 2018’s rout that the 10-year yield plunged almost 14 basis points on Feb. 5, capitalizing on haven demand as equities suffered steep losses. When stocks stabilized, yields marched higher again.Some strategists say a 3 percent 10-year yield represents the end of the stock market rally, with corporate borrowing costs becoming too punitive and fixed-income looking too appealing. Others, like Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, say 3.5 percent is the level to watch.Regardless of the exact level, bond traders may find that the best barometer of which way yields are headed after 3 percent will come from stocks. A bout of selling in equities probably means the “tug-of-war” between the two asset classes is alive and well, serving as a cap on yields and perhaps preventing too much tightening from the Federal Reserve. If stocks shrug at 3 percent, then it’s a green light for the selloff to carry on. Hedge funds and other large speculators have a lot riding on the outcome. The group has boosted short bets in 10-year Treasury futures to a record, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through Feb. 13. That positioning could exacerbate the market moves in either direction.Long-Run DivergenceLost in the question of “what’s next” is that 3 percent marks the highest yield on a 10-year Treasury note in more than four years. That’s a compelling proposition, particularly for hold-until-maturity investors, who are relatively insensitive to price swings.It’s tempting to wait for an even better entry point. But more than half of the 59 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg this month say the 10-year yield will end 2018 at or below 3 percent. After all, the Fed’s own projections call for its target rate to climb just above 3 percent in 2020, before settling at a longer-term rate of 2.75 percent.“If you think that 3 percent is where the Fed is going to stay, you’ll see a significant level of demand at those levels,” said Bruno Braizinha, a rates and cross-asset strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.His fellow strategists at Wall Street banks are finally seeing signs that the overwhelmingly bearish momentum is starting to fade.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., for instance, is looking to go long if yields keep climbing.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc isn’t waiting for 3 percent, instead recommending buying at 2.9 percent.Then there are those in the middle, like Cloherty at RBC. A 3 percent 10-year yield could serve as a good short-term trade, he said, because Japanese investors are likely to step in and buy after their fiscal year ends on March 31. But it’s probably headed higher toward the end of 2018.“The pattern will be a sideways slide for the second quarter and then we leak higher in the second half on Fed tightening and an awful lot of Treasury supply,” Cloherty said. “We see people trying to protect themselves more against higher rates, but I don’t think that just because we break 3 we’re destined to go to 3.5.”(Updates to add yields in third paragraph.)"

We've made mistakes too, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake,"" Khosrowshahi said in the interview. ""So I think that people make mistakes.

"By Lawrence WhiteLONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) plans to invest heavily in its newly combined retail and private banking business as it targets internationally minded customers in markets such as China, the United States and Singapore, the unit's Chief Executive Charlie Nunn told Reuters.Nunn, a former McKinsey consultant who joined HSBC (HK:0005) in 2011, was one of the biggest winners in the banking group's latest management reshuffle, taking control of a division with $1.4 trillion in clients' assets.The plan is to grow in the three major markets where HSBC has scale, namely Britain, Hong Kong and Mexico, focusing on mortgages, wealth and insurance products, and unsecured lending respectively.HSBC will also target wealthier customers who travel or invest often overseas in more than 10 markets such as China where its share is smaller, Nunn said. He was speaking to Reuters in the first interview by a senior HSBC executive since the bank announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs and restructure.""We're in some of the fastest-growing wealth markets in the world... the fact we now have a $1.4 trillion wealth business should be exciting for our customers and hopefully scary for our competitors,"" Nunn said.Nunn is already making management changes. HSBC named Kevin Martin, head of Asia Pacific retail banking and wealth management, as the chief operating officer of the new global wealth and personal banking business, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wealth and personal banking division combined two of HSBC's better-performing businesses in 2019, growing adjusted profits by 19% and 15% respectively.CHINESE DIASPORAAs part of its Asia expansion HSBC has hired some 800 frontline and support staff in wealth management since 2017, Nunn said, mainly product specialists and relationship managers for its private bank and 'Jade' offering for those with assets of $1 million-$5 million. ""We remain committed to really trying to capture share and be more relevant in the Greater Bay area of China,"" Nunn said.In an example of how the lender is targeting the global Chinese diaspora, HSBC has launched an international payment system allowing mainland Chinese customers to pay university fees directly, in renminbi, across 1,700 institutions worldwide.HSBC interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn said on Tuesday the bank is combining wealth and personal banking so it can boost profits from the transfer of products and investment between the two.HSBC will aim to expand a partnership with the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), to use its Aladdin investment management software in more markets.The bank will also extend its Lombard lending product which allows customers to borrow against assets they hold with the bank, for example to buy property for a family member.TOUGH COMPETITIONHSBC will face a tough challenge in its target markets, however, with domestic players dominating retail banking in the United States and China and global giants such as UBS (S:UBSG) ruling the market for wealthier clients.While HSBC's British and Hong Kong retail banking businesses have powered its profits in recent years, in other markets such as France its sub-scale high street banking presence has been a drag on earnings.The lender is attempting to sell that business, Reuters has previously reported. Nunn declined to comment on the progress of that strategic review but said a decision will be made in 1-2 months.He also declined to comment on other markets such as Turkey, Greece and Oman, previously reported by Reuters as earmarked for exit.""We'll continue to review markets on a case-by-case basis,"" Nunn said.

"By Jonathan Stempel and Trevor Hunnicutt(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) plans to vote against four board nominees proposed by  USG Corp  (N:USG), giving a boost to a $5.9 billion takeover bid by German's Gebr Knauf AG that the building products company had rejected.Berkshire, which is USG's largest shareholder with a 31 percent stake, announced its intention on Thursday, two days after Knauf called on USG shareholders to pressure that company to enter merger talks by withholding support for its director slate.Knauf owns about 10.5 percent of USG.""Berkshire's present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,"" Buffett's assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.A USG spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Knauf's takeover bid values USG at $42 per share. USG shares closed up 2.4 percent at $40.77 on Thursday. They closed at $33.51 on March 23, before Knauf's bid became public.Buffett has called his more than 17-year USG investment disappointing but ""no disaster.""A USG takeover could add to the $116 billion of cash and equivalents his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has to invest.""You don't normally see this kind of stuff from Berkshire,"" said Morningstar Inc analyst Greggory Warren. ""It's not like they need the capital.""Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance. Buffett has long preferred owning whole companies to individual stocks.Earlier on Thursday, USG sent an open shareholder letter calling Knauf's opposition to its director slate ""a misguided attempt"" to pressure the board into accepting a takeover ""substantially below our intrinsic value.""Berkshire's offer to sell its roughly 43.4 million USG shares essentially created a pricing floor for any sale.It was structured as a six-month option contingent on Knauf buying the rest of USG, with Knauf paying $2 per share upfront that Berkshire would keep if no merger occurred in that period.Berkshire has owned USG since 2000, the year before asbestos liabilities helped push the Chicago-based company into bankruptcy for five years.In 2008, after the housing market imploded, Berkshire bought $300 million of USG convertible debt, which was later swapped into stock.USG's board has 10 members but is ""staggered,"" meaning only four seats are being filled at its May 9 annual meeting.Chief Executive Jennifer Scanlon and Chairman Steven Leer are not among the directors up for election. USG also has a ""poison pill"" defense to help thwart unwelcome takeovers.Knauf said in a statement it is pleased by Berkshire's support. "

"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers and parts suppliers on Thursday warned that President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened car tariffs would undermine the benefits of the new deal to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, causing widespread job losses.At a wide-ranging hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission, labor representatives said the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) fails to include adequate enforcement of labor standards, while Southeastern U.S. fruit and vegetable growers said it leaves them vulnerable to subsidized Mexican competition.The testimony will feed into a study by the commission on the economic impact of the trade deal reached on Sept. 30, which could heavily influence support for it in the U.S. Congress. A vote on the pact is not expected until the spring of 2019, following a lengthy consultation process.Several automotive trade groups said side letters to the USMCA deal that allow Canada and Mexico duty-free auto import quotas in the event that Trump imposes car tariffs was an indication that such a move seemed inevitable.The Trump administration is considering recommendations from the Commerce Department on whether to impose tariffs on national security grounds under Section 232 of a Cold War-era trade law.No decisions have been made, but President Donald Trump has frequently threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on autos and parts to pressure the European Union and Japan to make trade concessions.""If implemented, increased auto tariffs would not only undermine the potential success of the USMCA, they would also pose a material threat to the economy and may result in the loss of as many as 700,000 jobs across the U.S.,"" said Jennifer Thomas, vice president of government affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.The groups also said the failure of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to lift steel and aluminum tariffs have cost the industry billions of dollars and trade turmoil in general has paralyzed investment decisions.""The current state of play on trade has placed our industry in turmoil,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. ""In the last year our members have faced Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, other Section 232 tariffs proposed, and Section 301 tariffs on goods from China.""DETROIT VS FOREIGN BRANDSThere also was a divergence of views among domestic and foreign automakers on the overall benefits of the USMCA agreement, which requires autos to have 75 percent regional content and at least 40 percent from the United States or Canada.John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers which represents foreign brand automakers with U.S. plants, said he was concerned that the ""many layered"" content requirements would hurt automakers' competitiveness by requiring ""unnecessary"" supply chain shifts and investment in compliance.Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Fiat Chrysler, described the trade deal as ""workable"" for these companies which have larger U.S. manufacturing footprints than their competitors.He said it would not require massive manufacturing and supply chain changes immediately but over time, automakers would need to consider changes in where they build cars and major components.CORN VS TOMATOESA similar divergence came from agriculture groups, where grain farmers and shippers said it was a ""significant advancement"" that expands market access but seasonal produce groups said it fails to address Mexican subsidies that are driving Southeastern growers out of business.An initial U.S. demand for the ability to impose seasonal tariffs to protect U.S. fruit and vegetable growers was abandoned during the 13-month negotiations.""We have gotten the short end of the stick since the ink dried on the agreement,"" said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.AFL-CIO trade policy specialist Celeste Drake said that the enforcement mechanism for new, higher labor standards was weak, relying on a seldom used state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism.""We urge the commission to make clear that if the obligations are not enforced, the lure of cheap and easy labor exploitation in Mexico will continue to draw production and hold down wages in both countries,"" she said.

"By Sarah YoungLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) forecast another year of growth in 2020, saying the company was well-placed to take advantage of increased defence spending that could help to offset any future impact from a German ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia.Full-year results announced on Thursday at the upper end of forecasts, helped to drive shares 3.5% higher at 664.6 pence by 0954 GMT.The maker of Typhoon fighters, combat vehicles and Astute Class nuclear-powered attack submarines, has been affected by a German ban announced in 2019 on exporting arms to Saudi Arabia.The export ban has put a question mark over a multi-billion pound deal to sell 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Riyadh, built by a BAE-led consortium that also includes MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Airbus (PA:AIR).CEO Charles Woodburn shrugged off its impact, saying there were other opportunities.""A number of European countries are looking to increase their defence spending and move closer to meeting their NATO commitments. The group is well-positioned to benefit,"" he told reporters on Thursday.The company expects Germany to order more of its Typhoon jets, anticipates higher sales at European missile maker MBDA, in which it owns a stake, and new orders for its Swedish-based land vehicle business.Woodburn also predicted business in the Middle East, despite the difficulties in Saudi Arabia.""Within the Middle East region, there are a number of other customers in addition to Saudi, who I think in future will be looking at additional Typhoons,"" he said. Oman, Kuwait and Qatar are existing customers.The Typhoon, whose full name is the Eurofighter Typhoon, is the most important combat aircraft in BAE Systems' portfolio.'RENEWED LIFE'BAE said its earnings per share would grow by a mid-single digit percentage next year. The group also said on Thursday it would make a 1 billion pound ($1.29 billion) one-off payment into its pension scheme in the coming months, funded by debt.Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said he was encouraged the company had addressed its pension deficit.""We figure there is certainly renewed life at BAE,"" he said.BAE's earnings per share were 45.8 pence for 2019, at the upper end of a forecast for a mid-single digit rise on 2018's 42.9 pence, helped by an improved operational performance, after a focus on boosting performance in its U.S. combat vehicle unit, and a slightly lower tax rate.BAE's results this year could exceed forecasts, as they exclude any boost from two U.S. acquisitions totalling $2.2 billion, which it announced in January and which should be completed this year."

"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the richest people in the U.S. are calling for a federal wealth tax.Financier George Soros, heiresses Liesel and Regan Pritzker, Abigail  Disney  and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). co-founder Chris Hughes are among those calling for the levy to help address income inequality and provide funding to address climate change and public health issues.“We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans -- on us,” according to a letter signed by 19 individuals -- one anonymously -- and posted online Monday. “The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans.”Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke support the idea, according to the letter. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on assets of $50 million or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1 billion. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.Read more: Sanders to propose taxing Wall Street to pay off student debtsThe wealth tax isn’t embraced by all Democrats because many believe it would be difficult to assess objectively the value of wealth like artwork and jewels. There are also concerns that such a tax is unconstitutional because the federal government is prohibited from taxing property, only income.The New York Times reported on the letter earlier Monday.Some of those signing have already expressed concerns about America’s rising inequality. Hughes has evangelized for higher taxes on the rich in his book “Fair Shot.” Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co., recently called Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”Another signatory, entrepreneur Nick Hanauer, first warned his “fellow zillionaires” about the country’s growing wealth divide in 2014, writing that “there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out.”Such inequality has only deepened. Last week, Bernard Arnault joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as the third person with a fortune of at least $100 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, whose 500 members have a total net worth of $5.5 trillion, up from $4.9 trillion two years ago.(Updates with additional comments starting in seventh paragraph.)"

"By Lawrence DelevingneNEW YORK (Reuters) - Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC rode bets on Asian stocks and U.S. corporate mergers to strong returns in 2017 - its best showing in years - but remained challenged by succession planning, declining assets and a stagnant stock price. Its flagship hedge fund, the OZ Master Fund Ltd, gained an estimated 10.4 percent net of fees in 2017, according to a letter sent to investors this week seen by Reuters. That was better than its historical average of 8.86 percent, its highest return since 2013, and above the benchmark HFRI asset-weighted composite gain of 6.52 percent.The performance, according to the letter, was driven by Asian shares such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Inc, JD.com Inc and Nintendo Co (T:7974), and mergers and acquisitions like pharmaceuticals business Actelion Ltd, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in June, and Aetna (NYSE:AET) Inc's proposed merger with CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). The New York hedge fund firm, which goes by ""Oz Management,"" also made money on U.S. corporate and structured credit and lost on U.S. stocks and convertible and derivative arbitrage, the letter said.A spokesman for Oz declined to comment. The strong performance comes amid a stalled succession plan for Daniel Och, the firm's billionaire founder and chief executive officer. Oz sent a letter to investors on Dec. 23 saying that it was ""not the right time"" to promote co-Chief Investment Officer James ""Jimmy"" Levin to CEO. It added that Och and the firm's board of directors hoped that the 34-year-old Levin, Och's longtime protégé and heir apparent, would remain as co-CIO. David Windreich is the other co-CIO.The December letter was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. The Oz communication to clients this week added that ""we hope to come back to you in the near future to present the (succession) plan.""Och, through a spokesman, and Levin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One of the few publicly traded hedge fund managers, Oz's stock price and assets have also not rebounded alongside its performance. Shares have languished around $4 or below since early 2016 and fell to $2.37 on Friday from around $3.20 a year ago. The issue is not new: Oz went public in November 2007 at $32 a share. The firm managed $31.9 billion as of Jan. 1, according to the new letter, down from $47.5 billion at the end of 2014 and $37.9 billion at the end of 2016, according to public filings.  "

"By Jeffrey Heller and Tova CohenJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police alleged on Tuesday that Benjamin Netanyahu's former spokesman tried to bribe a judge to drop a fraud case against Netanyahu's wife, the latest corruption investigation encircling the long-serving prime minister.The new bribery case was one of two revealed on Tuesday involving the same former spokesman, a close Netanyahu confidant. Police also named him as someone they had arrested two days earlier in a separate case involving allegations of corruption at Israel's biggest telecoms company.The rightwing leader, in office for 12 years since 1996, has seen his dominance of Israeli politics threatened by corruption investigations since police recommended a week ago that he be indicted for bribery and fraud.He has denied wrongdoing in what are now four separate investigations, including two in which he is personally a suspect. He says the allegations are a political ""witch hunt"".In the latest case, police said former Netanyahu spokesman Nir Hefetz had offered through an intermediary in 2015 to help a judge win the post of attorney-general if she agreed to use the position to block any proceedings against Netanyahu's wife Sara.Last September Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said he was considering indicting Sara Netanyahu for fraud over suspected use of state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. She has denied the allegations and a final decision on charges is pending.""HALLUCINATORY""The prime minister rejected the allegation about the attempt to bribe the judge, calling it ""hallucinatory"".""I never approached Nir Hefetz about this, he never proposed to me anything about it, and you know what? I do not believe he raised the possibility with anyone,"" Netanyahu said.A lawyer for Hefetz could not be reached.In the other case revealed on Tuesday, police said they had arrested Hefetz and another Netanyahu confidant, Shlomo Filber, who once ran the Communications Ministry, over allegations of corruption involving the telecoms firm Bezeq. (TA:BEZQ)Bezeq's main shareholder, Shaul Elovitch, was also arrested, along with his wife and son, and Bezeq's CEO Stella Handler. Elovitch is a family friend of the Netanyahus. The arrests took place on Sunday but were not disclosed for two days under standard Israeli procedure.Police suspect Bezeq received regulatory benefits in return for providing favorable media coverage of Netanyahu on Walla, a news website that is controlled by Elovitch's holding company Eurocom.Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing, as have his wife and son, and Bezeq CEO Handler, a Eurocom spokeswoman said. Filber's lawyer declined to comment.Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case but Israeli media said he was likely to be questioned soon.Last week, police recommended Netanyahu be indicted in two cases. In one he is suspected of bribery over his acknowledged receipt of gifts from wealthy businessmen, which police say were worth nearly $300,000. In the other, he is alleged to have offered the publisher of Israel's biggest daily to curtail circulation of a rival newspaper in return for positive coverage.Netanyahu, who has maintained his normal working schedule and is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on March 5, has denied all the allegations and vowed to remain in office to serve out his term, which runs until 2019.Mandelblit is weighing indictments in those investigations, with a decision possibly months away.

"By Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) beat Microsoft in the battle for the U.S. arm of TikTok with a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale to try to navigate geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, people familiar with the matter said.ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or a consortium led by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.While TikTok is best known for dancing videos that go viral among teenagers, U.S. officials are concerned user information could be passed to China's communist government. TikTok, which has as many as 100 million U.S. users, has said it would never share such data with Chinese authorities.Sale negotiations were upended when China updated its export control rules last month, giving it a say over the transfer of TikTok's algorithm to a foreign buyer. Reuters reported last week that China would rather see TikTok shut down in the United States than allow a forced sale.On Monday, China's state-run English television channel CGTN cited sources as saying ByteDance would not sell TikTok's U.S. operations to Oracle or Microsoft, and would not give the source code for the platform to any U.S. firm.Under ByteDance's latest proposal, Oracle would be the firm's technology partner and assume management of TikTok's U.S. user data, sources told Reuters on Sunday. Oracle is also negotiating taking a stake in TikTok's U.S. operations, they said.The data is currently stored in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's cloud.Some of ByteDance's top investors, including General Atlantic and Sequoia, will also be given minority stakes in those operations, one of the people said.PRECEDENTIt is unclear whether Trump, who wants a U.S. technology firm to own most of TikTok in the United States, will approve the deal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for national security risk, is overseeing the ByteDance-Oracle talks.""User data protection and assurances around how the company's algorithms push content to U.S. users are thoughtful components of a substantive solution, but whether they can change political outcomes is a much more difficult question,"" said regulatory lawyer John Kabealo, who is not involved in the talks.ByteDance plans to argue that CFIUS' approval two years ago of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's [OWREAC.UL] purchase of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc (NYSE:GNW) offers a precedent for its proposal with Oracle, the sources said.In that deal, China Oceanwide agreed to use a U.S.-based, third-party service to manage Genworth's U.S. policyholder data. ByteDance will argue a similar arrangement with Oracle can safeguard TikTok's U.S. user data, the sources said.ByteDance and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin declined to comment on Monday when asked at a press conference about the TikTok deal, but said TikTok was being ""encircled"" and ""coerced"" in the United States into a transaction. ""We urge the U.S. government to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for foreign firms operating and investing in the United States,"" he said. WALMART BLOWOracle's chairman Larry Ellison is one of the tech world's few Trump supporters. His firm has significant technological prowess in handling and safeguarding data, but no social media experience as its clientele comprises companies, rather than consumers.Peking University professor of investment Jeffrey Towson said Oracle's ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations with access, but not ownership, of ByteDance's core technology mirrored how many Western companies operate in China.Earlier on Sunday, Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok's U.S. operations. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which had joined Microsoft's bid, said it was still interested in investing, and that it would talk further with ByteDance and other parties.""This is bad news for Walmart more than anyone else,"" said Towson. ""Combining TikTok's entertainment and user engagement with its e-commerce platform was its best shot at catching up"" with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).TRUMP'S ORDERSAs Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong's autonomy, cybersecurity and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint.Trump signed two executive orders last month targeting TikTok and ByteDance. The first, effective Sept. 20, bans U.S. companies from transacting with them. The second requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Nov. 12.Were Trump to agree to ByteDance's proposed Oracle deal, he would have to rescind his order calling specifically for divestment.As many as 40% of Americans back Trump's threat to ban TikTok if it is not sold to a U.S. buyer, a Reuters/Ipsos national poll found last month. Among Republicans - Trump's party - 69% said they supported the order, though only 32% expressed familiarity with the app.'UNTRUSTED' APPSThe White House has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems ""untrusted"" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks. Beyond TikTok, Trump has also issued an order prohibiting transactions with Tencent Holding Ltd's messenger app WeChat.Earlier this year, Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd sold gay dating app Grindr, bought in 2016, for $620 million after CFIUS ordered its divestment.ByteDance acquired Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly - whose user base was largely American - for $1 billion in 2017 without seeking CFIUS approval, relaunching it as TikTok the following year. Reuters reported last year that CFIUS was investigating TikTok. "
"By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court was hearing on Tuesday whether a plumber hired on a self-employed basis should have received workers' rights, in a case which could affect the business models of major firms operating in the gig economy.Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL], car service Addison Lee and takeaway food courier Deliveroo are among those who hire their drivers as self-employed, entitling them only to basic protections such as health and safety.Workers receive the minimum wage, holiday pay and rest breaks, prompting unions to take legal action to end what they say are exploitative practices in the gig economy, where people tend to work for several firms without fixed contracts.Uber and other companies have defended their business models saying their drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and on average earn more than the minimum wage, but have lost a series of court cases on the issue. Tuesday's case involves Gary Smith who worked for the firm Pimlico Plumbers between 2005 and 2011 and took the company to an employment tribunal after being dismissed.A tribunal judge said the firm imposed restrictions on the work Smith could do and that he was obliged to perform a certain number of minimum hours on agreed days, meaning he should be considered a worker. Pimlico Plumbers has said that Smith's pay was ""extremely good"", allowing him to take care of his own holiday and sickness pay and that he fully understood his employment status. The firm unsuccessfully appealed the original decision at the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal, with the case now reaching the Supreme Court.Britain's top judges will hear the case on Tuesday and Wednesday and are expected to make a decision within three to six months, which would apply to everyone working on a self-employed basis in the same way across thousands of firms, according to a court spokesman.The government has faced increasing pressure from lawmakers and unions on how to handle modern working practices in recent months and launched a consultation after a review said many people at the biggest firms deserved more rights.

"By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Roku tumbled 7% on Friday after the streaming video company told customers it was removing Fox channels from its platform ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl broadcast.""On January 31, 2020, all standalone FOX channels will no longer be available on Roku streaming devices,"" Roku wrote in an email to customers on Thursday. It added that its viewers could watch Fox channels on other companies' services, including Hulu and Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) YouTube.Shares of  Fox Corp  (O:FOXA), which is broadcasting the National Football League championship game between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, fell about 1%.The removal of Fox from its platform is related to the Jan. 31 expiration of an agreement between the two companies.""Roku's tactics are a poorly timed negotiating ploy, fabricating a crisis with no thought for the alarm it generated among its own customers,"" Fox said in a statement sent to Reuters.Roku did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Carriage disputes between networks and cable providers in the past have led to viewers losing the ability to watch channels. Last July, millions of DirecTV subscribers temporarily lost access to CBS programming in over a dozen cities.While viewership has declined in recent years, the Super Bowl remains the single most watched U.S. event of the year, making it a potentially high-value pawn in contract negotiations.Riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over the consumer shift from cable television to streaming, Roku's stock has surged almost 800% since its initial public offering in 2017. Friday's sell-off reduces Roku's 12-month return to 172% and leaves it at a level last seen in November."

"By Elizabeth DiltsNEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) lowered its outlook for 2019 net interest income by about $500 million on Tuesday, following similar moves by rival big banks  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).""Our (net interest income) will be a little bit lower than we told you last time,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said at Barclays' Financial Services Conference in New York. ""I think we told you $57.5 (billion) and I'm closer to $57 (billion) for this year.""That is a lower forecast for full-year net interest income than the bank gave in mid-July and it shows that banks with large pools of customer deposits are struggling to make as much money amid lower interest rates and an inverted yield curve.On Monday, top brass from Citi and Wells Fargo tempered their outlooks for net interest income. Citi now expects net interest income to be up 3% to 4% for the year, compared with prior guidance of 4% growth.Wells Fargo lowered its projections for the second time this year. The bank's chief financial officer said it expects net interest income to fall 6% in 2019, compared with 5% stated previously.Dimon also said JPMorgan Chase expects third-quarter trading revenues to be 10% lower than in the second quarter, while fees from mergers and acquisitions will likely be flat in comparison with the prior quarter.

"By Peter Nurse   Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, as the corporate earnings season kicks into full gear, with the focus on the key banking sector.At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, the Dow futures contract rose 10 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 15 points, or 0.1%. These cash indices closed lower Tuesday, ending a four-day win streak, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.6% lower, the S&P 500 down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.1%. However, they haven't registered consecutive down days this month.The banking sector, often seen as an important guage of the strength of the overall economy, will be in focus Wednesday, with third-quarter earnings from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due. These follow above-estimate earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in the previous session.Outside of the major banks, there are also earnings due from the likes United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), on the heels of Delta's (NYSE:DAL) disappointing quarterly update, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA).Still, investors face a number of headwinds, with Covid-19 cases continuing to mount, vaccine trials facing difficulties and a new stimulus bill remaining something of a mirage. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate would vote next week on a targeted $500 billion coronavirus economic aid bill. This is extremely unlikely to pass through the House given it’s the type of deal Democrats have rejected in the past as not being enough.Turning to economic data, September's producer price index is the key release Wednesday. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.2% on the month, climbing at a slightly slower pace than the previous month. This would duplicate the pattern on consumer prices, which after several months of above-trend gains, look like they are normalizing. Both headline and core CPI, released Tuesday, increased by 0.2% month-to-month in September.Oil prices weakened Wednesday on concerns that fuel demand will continue to falter as rising coronavirus cases across Europe and in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, cause economic growth to wane.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for oil demand in 2021 by 80,000 barrels per day to 96.84 million barrels per day in its monthly report on Tuesday, citing damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The weekly report on crude inventories by the American Petroleum Institute is due later in the session, having been delayed by a day because of the Columbus day holiday on Monday.U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $40.33 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $42.39.Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,904.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1741. "

" SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Blizzard Entertainment has reduced the punishment that it dealt out to a Hong Kong-based Hearthstone esports player for his public support of pro-democracy protests in the city, after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public.The U.S. games publisher, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), said last week that it would suspend the player Chung ""blitzchung"" Ng Wai from competition for a year and strip him of prize money after he called for the liberation of Hong Kong in a post-game interview.The decision made the company the latest corporate name to get caught up in tensions relating to the Hong Kong protests, garnering it support in China but also drawing criticism from fans, players and commentators in the West, some of whom said that they would stop working with Blizzard as a result of its decision.However on Saturday, Blizzard said it had decided to cut his punishment to a six month suspension and would still award him his prize money, with its president J. Allen Brack saying the company had ""reacted too quickly"" in making its decision.Brack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules, but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision.""I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,"" he said in a post on Blizzard's website.Chung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard's decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in the future, but urged the company to reconsider its decision to penalize two commentators at the tournament where he had made his remarks.The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests.Last week, the NBA became the target of a fierce backlash in China after one of its team managers posted a now-deleted tweet that expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters, which Chinese state media characterized as the latest example of meddling in China’s own affairs."

"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the additional funding Congress is poised to approve Thursday to help small businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic should be the last round, but advocates fear it’ll run out quickly and won’t be enough for mom-and-pop shops struggling to stay open.The U.S. House is expected to pass a bill Thursday afternoon including $320 billion more for a loan program to keep workers on payrolls. The program, which was launched by the Small Business Administration April 3 with $349 billion, ran out after just 13 days. Lawmakers are also adding $60 billion for a separate disaster loan and grant program whose coronavirus-related funding was exhausted last week.Mnuchin said this week he expects this would be the last round of funding because there are now other financing opportunities for small businesses, including more money for the disaster loans and the Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending facility.But small business advocates have estimated that as much as $1 trillion could be needed. They say as large banks are ready to flood the SBA with hundreds of thousands of applications totaling tens of billions of dollars, the additional money could be gone in a few days -- and it’s not clear how many small firms, especially those that haven’t applied yet, can get funding.“This next tranche is not going to be enough, obviously,” said Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. “There’s only so much in the funding pot that is available, and the smallest of small businesses unfortunately are not getting access to this capital.”Lawmakers also said more funding would be needed during a House Small Business Committee hearing on the loan program Thursday. “We all know it’s going to need more money again soon,” said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.Applications for the initial PPP funds were being processed at a rate of about $40 billion a day in the final days before funding was exhausted, signaling that the replenishment could tap out quickly.Some large, publicly traded companies and big chains such as  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). that have been criticized for tapping the loan fund may opt for the Main Street facility, making more money available for smaller businesses, said Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis for the National Federation of Independent Business.The U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidance on Thursday emphasizing that borrowers must certify in good faith they need the loan, saying it’s “unlikely” a public company with substantial market value and access to capital will be able to do so. Firms that have already taken money can return it by May 7 without penalty, the guidance said.Still, an NFIB survey of its members on April 17 showed 26% were in the process of submitting an application for loans when funding was exhausted, and it’s not clear how many will be able to access funding before it runs out again, Wade said. Also, there were potentially millions of self-employed individuals and independent contractors shut out because they couldn’t start applying immediately, she said.“It’s a good second push to get money to small business owners, but there’s still a large number of small business owners who are still waiting to access this program,” Wade said.The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, offers loans of as much as $10 million that convert to grants if proceeds are used to keep workers on the payroll and cover rent and other expenses for two months. The SBA guarantees the loans for lenders to disburse, and there’s no comprehensive accounting yet of how much money has reached small firms.The SBA also stopped accepting applications last week for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, or EIDL, that offers low-interest financing and emergency advances of as much as $10,000 that don’t have to be repaid. Congress is adding $50 billion for loans and $10 billion for grants to that program.More than 1.6 million small businesses were approved for PPP funding before the money ran out, with an average loan of $206,000, according to an SBA report. About 755,500 firms have received EIDL grants and almost 27,000 disaster loans have been approved so far, the SBA reported Monday. But there have been millions of EIDL applications, and there are about 30 million small businesses in the U.S. employing about half the workforce.Congress will likely have to replenish the funds if they run out again, said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He compared the PPP to an incomplete bridge.“I don’t think we’re at the point where we can realistically say, ‘The bridge has stopped and we’re sorry if you fall off the end of it,’” he said.The next funding round includes a $60 billion carve-out for small lenders, which is designed to help them compete with larger banks that will be more actively issuing loans this time, said Paul Merski of the Independent Community Bankers of America.Even though there is money set aside for smaller banks and financial institutions to lend, that won’t fix the problem that companies with existing banking relationships “are still going to get at the front of the line,” said John Arensmeyer, chief executive officer of the Small Business Majority, a small business advocacy group.Arnesmeyer said he thinks Mnuchin “will change his tune” about the need for additional funding in a couple of weeks when the crisis gets worse and the problems faced by small firms deepen.“The sheer magnitude of businesses that don’t have revenue and are closing and/or laying massive numbers of people is staggering,” he said.Sinnidra Taylor said she has little hope that her business, the Crazy Waffle Bar in New Orleans will see any of the newly approved funds for the PPP.“I am excited that they have allotted more money. I am also not confident that I will get any,” Taylor said. “I have the feeling small businesses such as mine are being overlooked and falling through the cracks.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's High Court ordered state arms maker Denel to hand over millions in employees' tax payments to the government, union officials said - a case that has refocused attention on cash-strapped state firms and their drain on the economy.The Solidarity union sued Denel last month, accusing it of deducting tax and other payments from employees' salaries then failing to hand the cash over to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and other bodies.Solidarity claimed Tuesday's ruling as a victory in what it described as a broader fight to hold state firms to account. A Denel spokeswoman it had not received details of the ruling but would meet its obligations. She said Denel had approached SARS to see if it could delay payments.The lawsuit came after Denel, a cornerstone of South Africa's once-mighty defense industry, said it would not be able to pay employees their full salaries in June and asked the government for a 2.8 billion rand ($182.43 million) cash injection a week later.Denel's recapitalization request, one of a clutch of bailouts needed for debt-ridden state-run companies, has piled pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa who has promised to overhaul Africa's most industrialized economy after decades of corruption and mismanagement.Investors and credit rating agencies raised the alarm in July, when the government said it would give power utility Eskom 59 billion rand of additional financial support over the next two years, on top of an already-promised bailout of 230 billion rand spread over the next decade.Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity's Legal Services, told Reuters he thought the ruling would cost Denel millions of rand.""It is regrettable that we had to go to court just to draw Denel's attention to payments that it should have made a while ago.”The company, which produces military equipment from ammunition to attack helicopters, has said it is trying to turn its operations around by exiting loss-making businesses and pushing to win contracts to ease liquidity constraints."

The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of overstating the benefits of opioids while downplaying the risks and allege distributors failed to flag and halt a rising tide of suspicious orders.A closely watched opioid trial pitting New York state against McKesson, Johnson & Johnson and others was postponed in March due to the coronavirus outbreak.

"By Emma Rumney and Barbara LewisCULLINAN, South Africa (Reuters) - The owner of one of the world's most famous diamond mines could be about a decade away from clearing its multi-million-dollar debts, in a sign of the struggles facing an industry assailed by synthetic rivals and uncertain demand. Petra Diamonds bought Cullinan in 2008, aiming to breathe new life into the South African mine renowned for yielding the largest rough gem diamond ever found - 3,106 carats - and being the world's main source of rare blue diamonds.The London-listed miner, which acquired Cullinan from industry leader De Beers, borrowed heavily to revamp the facility and began mining a new section of ore last July.Petra told Reuters its debts from the mine stood at around 65 percent of its overall $650 million in borrowing, which would represent about $420 million.Cullinan's general manager Juan Kemp added that it could take ""between five and 10 years"" from the opening of the new section to clear the debts related to the mine. That goes beyond the 2022 maturity of Petra's bond notes. The company says it expects to generate free cash flow this year - a target it had hoped to reach in 2017 before being derailed by strikes and construction delays - and start reducing its debts. Kemp said one thought kept him awake at night: ""When will we get that next big stone?""Ben Davis, mining analyst at Liberum, said the diamond prices Petra had achieved were below market expectations.""Everyone is very much hoping, for the sake of the equity holders and debt holders, it will deliver more higher-quality stones,"" he added.The miner's difficulties reflect in part the problems facing the industry - which often takes years to recover huge investments - including new competition from synthetic diamonds and sluggish demand, especially for small stones.In a sign of the times, De Beers, owned by  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), last year abandoned its decades-old policy of refusing to sell man-made diamonds as jewelry. GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ic5k2ODIAMOND PRICESMan-made diamonds require less investment than mining natural stones and can offer more attractive margins.Synthetic producers spend around $300-500 per carat produced, according to a 2018 report by Bain & Company. De Beers' lab-grown diamonds sell for $800 per carat. Petra, by contrast, has to shift 20,000 tonnes of earth at Cullinan to yield one cup of diamonds, at an average cost in the first half of their financial year of $55 per carat, leaving it with a margin of $41 per carat. Industry experts say synthetic production accounts for a small percentage of the market, but is growing fast. De Beers is investing $94 million over four years to build a U.S. factory that will churn out 500,000 carats a year, for example, while Chinese producers are stepping up output.Prices are also under pressure. Diamond miners say sales are seasonal and fall off after the Christmas rush, but the industry's giants have nonetheless reported weaker prices. Alrosa, the world's biggest diamond seller by volume, said in January sales were down 44 percent year on year, while De Beers, the biggest seller by value, said the first 2019 sales cycle was 25 percent lower than in 2018. ""Diamond prices have come under pressure from a toxic combination of deteriorating consumer confidence in China, growth in synthetic jewelry capacity, working capital finance withdrawal ... and jewelry recycling,"" Davis said.The tougher landscape is widening the disparities within the diamond mining industry itself. Big players, led by De Beers and Alrosa, have the money and technology to expand in places such as Namibia and Russia, while mid-tier miners like Petra, and smaller players look to eke out the resources from older mines. Petra gained control of Cullinan, east of Pretoria, for $80 million. Previous owner De Beers had dismissed the 116-year-old mine as not profitable enough. For Petra, it is its flagship project and its most capital-heavy, and thus central to shareholder confidence. DIRTY COLORA single large, valuable stone could bring in millions of dollars and lighten Petra's debt load. So far, however, the only large stones recovered from the new mining section have been a dirty color, and low quality. Kemp said the new section, which analysis suggests should be rich, had yet to show what it can produce. ""We expect a large stone at some point,"" he said. In the absence of rarer gems and weak prices for small diamonds, averages for Cullinan stones have slipped from $140 per carat in the first half of its 2018 financial year to an expected $96 for the first half of this year - the lowest since 2010. That helped prompt a 30-percent fall in Petra's share price since it published prices in January, extending a steep decline over the previous two years. The miner has bought and developed four other African mines. Jacques Breytenbach, Petra's finance director, said pricing at Cullinan was variable from one period to the next, and that the market tended to be weaker at the end of the calendar year due to destocking. An increase in diamond tenders in the second half of Petra's financial year would make a big difference to cash generation, he added.Small miners are more vulnerable to adverse industry trends than the bigger players, whose volumes improve the probability of success, according to Bernstein analyst Paul Gait.""Their size allows the laws of large numbers to work on their side,"" he said. ""You're not just reliant on the belief that in a few years' time you will find a stone of 1,000 carats.""  "
"(Bloomberg) -- One hedge fund manager is getting some inspiration from an unlikely source: the Robinhood crowd.Adam Sender’s volatility hedge fund has climbed 30% this year -- in part by betting on and against stocks that have been popular on the retail trading app. He notched gains by wagering around stocks including carmakers Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc., NIO Inc. and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.By watching Robinhood traders, Sender is embracing the speculative fervor brought on by retail investors who have far less experience and insight into the companies. Robinhood has become a go-to trading platform for individual investors during the Covid-19 pandemic, who are largely stuck at home without much entertainment.The day trading crowd has “created the late ‘90s type of environment I thrive on,” Sender said in an interview, referring to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. A significant portion of the gains were also made by betting on S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, as well as large-cap technology names.Founded in 2016, Sender Company & Partners is among a handful of volatility funds taking advantage of the return of market turbulence sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. And the fund has outperformed its peers. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, an early indicator of industry performance, is roughly flat this year through July.In a bet on tech, some of Sender’s top holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). All were up in the first seven months, with PayPal rising the most at about 81%.Sender previously worked for Steve Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors before starting Exis Capital Management in 1998.

His paycheck is also tied to that success -- the fund charges 40% for performance, but has a 0% management fee.“Unfortunately, the hedge fund industry has become an asset-gathering strategy,” Sender said of wanting to stay small. “Back when I started in the industry, hedge funds were geared for absolute performance -- they weren’t geared for safety.”©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

"By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - Airbus urged European governments to step up plans for a ""likely"" no-deal Brexit and settle a long-running subsidy dispute with the United States to help limit trade risks for Europe's largest planemaker.The twin concerns surrounding Airbus's cross-border factory network prompted Chief Executive Guillaume Faury to issue a warning about rising trade tensions even as he unveiled stronger than expected second-quarter profits, driving up Airbus shares.Airbus builds wings for commercial aircraft in Britain, where new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to lead the country out of the European Union on Oct. 31 whether he has secured a negotiated departure or not, fuelling speculation in currency markets of a disorderly Brexit.""It is now obvious that 'no deal' is likely and we want all governments to be prepared for that, which was not the case by end of March,"" Faury told reporters, referring to Britain's originally planned exit date from the EU. His comments echo those of Britain's employers' group, which says the EU is less prepared for a no-deal Brexit than Britain.The European Commission says it has published almost 100 preparedness notices including several on aviation and overseen dozens of other legal steps to be ready for a no-deal Brexit.Airbus has built a stockpile of about one month's supply of aircraft parts as a buffer to cope with Britain leaving the EU without a transitional deal, Faury said. That contributed to a heavy drain on cash in the first half of the year.Plane parts are exempt from default World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs under a 1980 pact signed by both the EU and Britain in its own right. But Airbus is worried extra red tape could slow supply chains and hamper the movement of engineers.Faury also sounded a broader alarm about rising global tensions and in particular recent U.S. threats to impose sanctions on European planes and other goods following WTO rulings against European government subsidies to Airbus.The French CEO called for a settlement in the long-running dispute, while Airbus included a warning in its results for the first time of damage to deliveries and finances if the punitive tariffs go ahead. The EU is gearing up to impose counter-tariffs after the WTO ruled separately against U.S. subsidies to Boeing (NYSE:BA).""It’s important that there is a resolution at a given point, a settlement before tariffs are applied,"" Faury said.""We see the trade wars around the world growing and we don't believe this is something ... industry can benefit from and citizens can benefit from,"" he said.PROFIT BEATEurope's largest aerospace group said second-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 72% to 1.98 billion euros ($2.2 billion), led by strong demand for jetliners. Revenues rose 23% to 18.32 billion euros.Analysts were on average forecasting adjusted quarterly operating income of 1.77 billion euros on revenues of 17.82 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.Shares in Airbus opened up 1.2% against a flat market.Airbus is trying to overcome industrial delays at a newly expanded plant in Hamburg, Germany, which has been struggling with enhanced cabins for the in-demand A321neo single-aisle.Airbus kept annual delivery and financial targets, but said it was studying how to increase the share of the A321neo within the wider A320neo family, with more details expected in months.Airbus is nonetheless on course to be the world's largest planemaker in 2019 as U.S. rival Boeing faces a longer-than-expected grounding of its 737 MAX, ordered by worldwide regulators in March in the wake of two fatal accidents.Boeing last week posted its largest-ever quarterly loss due to the crisis.Airbus took 75 million euros in new charges in the second quarter related to the cost of winding down its A380 superjumbo program after deciding to scrap output due to weak demand.Air France-KLM on Tuesday announced plans to retire the world's largest jetliner to concentrate on smaller models like the A350, which Airbus said was on track to break even this year after progress in curbing costs.Airbus took 90 million euros in other charges including compliance costs as it pursues a four-year-old investigation into the use of middlemen in aircraft and other sales. People familiar with the matter have said Airbus hopes to submit the results of its own internal probe to UK and French investigators around the end of the year - a step toward what it hopes will result in a fine rather than criminal charges.Faury declined detailed to comment on the probe.""It’s going in the right direction, it’s progressing, but I’m unable to tell you when it will come to an end,"" he said.

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday his government was not contemplating reopening auctions this year for oil and gas blocks, saying contracts were already handed out during the previous administration and firms needed to invest.""It's not contemplated,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily press conference when asked if his government was considering offering auctions for oil and gas blocks.Lopez Obrador, who has been in office for a year, has shifted sharply away from some of the business-friendly policies of his predecessor, centrist President Enrique Pena Nieto, who enacted a sweeping energy market liberalization in 2013.While Lopez Obrador has said he would not seek to constitutionally reverse those reforms, he has canceled competitive oil and power auctions since he took office in December 2018."

"By Brendan PiersonNEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkey's state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB) has agreed to enter a formal plea of not guilty to criminal charges that it helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions, backing down from its previous refusal to answer the allegations, a lawyer for the bank said on Tuesday.The bank has maintained that the federal court in Manhattan where it is charged has no jurisdiction over it. The case, which has caused tension between the United States and Turkey, accuses Halkbank of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions through sham transactions in gold, food and medicine.Andrew Hruska, the bank's U.S. lawyer, said at a court hearing that the bank had been reassured it would not give up its right to challenge the court's jurisdiction by responding to the charges. He said he had been given permission by the bank's general manager to enter a plea on its behalf.""Now that those issues have been resolved, we're ready to proceed,"" he said.U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ordered Hruska to obtain written authorization from Halkbank before entering the plea. Another hearing is scheduled on March 3.The bank's change of course came after U.S. prosecutors asked the judge to hold it in contempt for failing to respond and impose heavy fines, beginning at $1 million per day and doubling each week.The charges against Halkbank, announced last October, followed related charges brought by U.S. prosecutors against nine individuals since 2016.They included former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was convicted in January 2018 after another defendant, wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, pleaded guilty and testified against him.Atilla returned to Turkey last year after leaving prison, and became general manager of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.The case is U.S. v.

"By John McCrank(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) on Wednesday agreed to a long-awaited experiment to test the effects of lowering stock exchange fees following criticism the current pricing system ultimately hurts investors.The pilot would force exchanges to lower the fees they charge for matching buy and sell orders and the size of rebates they pay market makers, allowing the SEC to analyze if the current system distorts traders' decisions about where to send orders.Consumer advocates say the current pricing regime creates conflicts of interest by giving incentives for brokers to send their customers’ orders to the exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would obtain the best result for the end clients.Currently, the fees exchanges can charge for trades they execute are capped at 30 cents per 100 shares. Rebates, which not all exchanges pay, are generally in line with the fee cap.The so-called access fee pilot, first proposed in July 2016 by a committee of market experts picked by the SEC, would require all exchanges to test capping fees lower than their current levels across different buckets of stocks, reducing the amount of funds available to pay rebates.One bucket would offer no rebates at all.On Wednesday, the Commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposal for the transaction fee pilot.""The transaction-fee pilot should give the Commission significantly more robust data than we have now to assess how fees and rebates affect order routing, execution quality, and market depth,"" Commissioner Robert Jackson said in a statement.The three main U.S. exchange operators had strongly opposed the plan, saying it would make stocks harder to trade. Those operators are the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, Cboe Global Markets Inc, which owns No. 2 U.S. stock exchange Bats, and Nasdaq Inc The bourses collectively pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, which they have said compensate market makers for the risks of providing liquidity. Without that additional liquidity, investors, listed companies and exchanges would all suffer, they say.The exchanges also said that without the ability to pay rebates, it would be harder for them to compete with private broker-run trading venues, known as dark pools, which have fewer regulatory burdens.The full details of the SEC pilot proposal will be released at a later date and subject to industry feedback.

"Investing.com - Asian markets were mostly lower in morning trade on Monday as Beijing released a white paper on the weekend and blamed the U.S. for escalating the trade war.The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component declined 0.7% and 0.6% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.6%.Over the weekend, China issued a white paper that claimed the U.S. is an untrustworthy negotiator and blamed it for starting global trade problems.The escalating trade war has not “made America great again” and “will only make things worse for all sides,” the paper said, as trade actions taken by U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have done serious harm to the U.S. economy due to increased production costs.Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said at a press conference on Sunday that the main reason trade talks stalled last month was that “the U.S. has backtracked.”“During the consultations, China has overcome many difficulties and put forward pragmatic solutions. However, the U.S. has backtracked, and when you give them an inch, they want a yard,” Wang said.Separately, Dai Xianglong, former governor of the People’s Bank of China, warned in a press event on Friday that the global economy would decline “if the China-U.S. trade war continues to grow larger, it may cause the global economy to decline.”“The consequence of the China-U.S. trade war not only will be reflected in both countries, but will also extend to relevant regions, extend to the whole world.”“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he added.On Sunday, China implemented previously announced tariff hikes and said it will take action against “unreliable” foreign companies, with a list of violators pending.Although not a major directional driver, a private survey showed China’s Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers’ Index for May was 50.2, slightly above the expected level of 50.“The stronger rise in overall new business supported a renewed expansion in buying activity among Chinese manufacturing firms.

"By Gleb StolyarovNIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia (Reuters) - Germany's Daimler and some others have stopped dealing with sanctions-hit van maker GAZ, controlled by Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, he told reporters, adding he was ready to give up control of the company.Deripaska and some of the businesses which he controls were hit by U.S. sanctions a year ago, when Washington imposed sweeping measures on some of Russia's biggest companies and business figures to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity.""Sanctions against GAZ, Russia's biggest van maker, have not yet taken full effect due to licenses for extensions issued by Washington, but are impacting the company, Deripaska said.""It's a tough time,"" he told reporters on Tuesday on a visit to the GAZ factory in Russia's central region of Nizhny Novgorod.If sanctions are not lifted, he said, there was no chance GAZ would survive, even if the company is granted another extension in early July, because these extensions ""do not give you full freedom.""A lot of suppliers and partners have stopped working with GAZ due to the risk of secondary sanctions, Deripaska said, adding there was also huge pressure on GAZ from its banks.GAZ, which competes with a joint venture between Ford and its Russian partner Sollers among others, mainly sells its vehicles in Russia and the former Soviet Union, making it less dependent on dollar sales.MARKET SHARE However, GAZ has contracts with Western partners and relies on vital supplies of foreign components. Along with Daimler, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and U.S.-based Cummins (NYSE:CMI) have contracts with GAZ.Volkswagen, Daimler and Cummins did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment.The company is also losing market share to rivals like Toyota and Ford, Deripaska added.GAZ did not disclose its 2018 sales. According to the AEB lobby group, its sales of light commercial vehicles, or vans and minibuses, rose 4 percent in 2018 to 60,677.The U.S. Treasury said in March it was extending by four months to July 6 a deadline for investors to divest from GAZ, giving Deripaska more time to lower his stake and potentially allowing the company to be removed from the U.S. sanctions list.Washington lifted sanctions on Deripaska's main assets - aluminum maker Rusal and its parent En+ - in January after he dropped control in them. Asked if he was ready to give up control of GAZ, Deripaska said: ""Yes, as it was done in En+.""Yet GAZ does not have such weight in global markets as Rusal and En+, so talks on any deal are slower and more difficult, sources close to GAZ previously told Reuters.Deripaska himself remains blacklisted and is suing the United States, alleging it had overstepped its legal powers in imposing sanctions on him.He admits his suit against Washington ""would be a difficult case"" but still hopes his name will eventually be cleared, he told reporters.

"By Ishita Palli(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) on Saturday said its payment registers were back online after a systems outage stopped customers in the United States from paying for in-store purchases.The outage was caused by an ""internal technology issue"" that lasted for about two hours and was not a data breach or security-related issue, Target said in a statement https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2019/06/target-addresses-register-outage-all-stores-back-o?ref=tgt_soc_f1ijw&afid=TW_BR&cpng=Other_Other_pub_GET.The retailer said no guest information was compromised.

"By Engen Tham and Anshuman DagaSHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some airlines affiliated with China's HNA Group Co Ltd are delaying aircraft lease payments to lessors, and Export-Import Bank of China, which is a long-term financer of the group, has formed a team to handle the conglomerate's liquidity issues, several banking and leasing sources said.Executives from leasing units of Chinese lenders including Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988), China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd (SS:600016) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) have held talks with some HNA-linked airlines to recover payments, the sources said.""Some payments have been delayed by over two months,"" said one senior Beijing-based executive at a Chinese lessor. He said HNA airlines had informed the lessor that payments would be made soon as they expected banks to support HNA in coming months.HNA, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, said in a statement to Reuters: ""HNA and its subsidiaries are maintaining stable operations, and are in the process of gradually paying each lessor's fees as planned.""HNA's $50 billion worth of deal-making over the past two years, which included investments in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBkGn) and the Hilton (N:HLT) hotels group, has sparked intense scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.In June, the Chinese government told major banks to review their credit exposure to HNA and a handful of other non-state companies, putting pressure on its finances.Some of the sources from lessors and banks said HNA's flagship Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) and smaller ones including Lucky Air and Capital Airlines had missed payments, while Tianjin Airlines was seeking to extend the term for payments due this year.The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Lucky Air and Capital Airlines declined to comment. Tianjin Airlines, Bank of Communications Financial Leasing, Minsheng Financial Leasing and EXIM did not respond to requests for comment.Hainan Airlines suspended trading on Jan. 10 pending an announcement. The reason for the share suspension is unclear.Tianjin Airlines has asked a Chinese lessor to delay June rental payments for three aircraft, said one source with direct knowledge.Another source said one HNA-affiliated airline has told Bank of Communications Financial Leasing that it will not be paying rental payments due in January. He did not name the airline.In the last few weeks, executives from some international lessors have flown to China to meet executives at HNA-affiliated airlines and thrash out a repayment plan, the sources said.""This is a widespread issue among many lessors but they understand that a lot depends on whether banks re-open their funding for HNA and lessors are betting on that,"" said one financier at a European bank.In November, Airfinance Journal reported the delays in lease rental payments and the problems have intensified since then, the sources said.However, Robert Martin, the chief executive of BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588), said his company, the leasing unit of Bank of China, did not have problems on lease payments by HNA-linked airlines.""BOC Aviation has very strong focus on receivables management and we ended 2017 with a collection rate of 99.9 percent. This included airline subsidiaries of the HNA Group,"" Martin said in an e-mail.RECOVERY GROUPFaced with a slew of repayment obligations and concerns about rising financing costs, HNA had its creditworthiness downgraded in November by S&P Global Ratings, as a result of its ""aggressive financial policy"".Underlining the growing concern by lenders over the group's repayment obligations, the Beijing-based EXIM set up a team this month to handle HNA's debt, which the conglomerate is struggling to repay, banking sources said.HNA has promised to pay all outstanding delayed payments by the end of January, said a source with direct knowledge.EXIM did not respond to request for comments.EXIM's HNA team was set up after meetings at the conglomerate's headquarters in Hainan, in southern China, late last year, when HNA asked for new loans to cover existing debt, the source said.HNA has also been attempting to re-organize its debt commitments from other lenders, the banking sources said.BIG PLAYERHNA Group has 223 planes on either financial or operating leases, according to financial reports at the end of June, making up around 62 percent of their fleet.Many aircraft leases in China are full-recourse leases, said David Yu, a professor and aircraft leasing specialist at New York University Shanghai. This means lessors are on the hook for the money banks have lent them to acquire the planes, putting them at risk of default, he said.Depending on the terms of the loans, lenders would be able to take steps including asking for early repayment of loans to seizing planes for sale. But the lessors for the HNA airlines had not taken any steps to seize any planes as they were confident of receiving the payments, the sources said."
"Investing.com – Stocks slumped on Monday, as industrial and technology stocks were shunned amid rising U.S.-China trade tensions after China launched counter-tariffs against U.S. goods.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked 2.38%, the S&P 500 lost 2.41%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3.41%.Beijing said it would raise tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. imports from June 1, prompting fears that tit-for-tat tariffs between both nations could return and hurt the world's two largest economies.U.S.-China tariffs could shave 0.5% off China's GDP, lower U.S. GDP by 0.25% and cut global GDP by 0.15%, said Societe Generale).In the wake of tariffs from Beijing, President Donald Trump offered investors some hope, saying he has not decided whether to put tariffs on remaining $325 billion in Chinese goods.But that did little to boost trade-sensitive corners of the market with industrials and technology leading the steep decline in the broader market.Industrials slumped than 3% as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), bellwethers of international trade, tumbling more than 4%.Adding to Boeing's woes were fears aviation regulators may delay lifting bans on the aircraft maker's maligned 737 Max jets, which were recently involved in two fatal crashes, until mid to late August.Chip stocks, meanwhile, pressured tech stocks on fears the return of the U.S.-China trade war may dent the economic recovery in China, one of the biggest semiconductor investors.Consumer discretionaries were also down sharply, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Energy stocks also contributed to the decline, falling more than 1% after U.S. oil prices came under pressure on fears the trade war could dent demand for oil from China, the world's largest energy consumer.In other company news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventured into subscription television after Apple TV Channels went live.Elsewhere, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) added to losses following its market debut on Friday, falling 10.75%, after CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reportedly sent an email to employees saying ""obviously our stock did not trade as well as we had hoped post-IPO.

"By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) - About 100 United Steelworkers union (USW) members rallied on Wednesday outside a  LyondellBasell Industries  (N:LYB) Houston oil refinery over a lack of negotiations there on a new local contract. Talks on a national oil-workers agreement are due to begin next month with Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa), as the lead industry negotiator. Existing union contracts expire on Feb. 1. However, local groups are beginning discussions on individual plant issues ahead of the national talks. At least four other plants also have begun exchanging proposals on local issues, according to the USW. LyondellBasell officials did not begin talks on union local issues as planned on Monday, Marcos Velez, a USW International representative said in an interview on Wednesday. The existing contract covering the plant's 485 union workers expires on Feb. 1.""They called and said they couldn't make it (Monday) and would call about meeting Tuesday,"" Velez said. ""It's Wednesday and we're still waiting to meet.""A Lyondell spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday.The USW group carried signs that said ""coming soon"" and showed silhouettes of people picketing. Union-represented Lyondell workers were off their jobs for 3 1/2 months during a strike and contract talks in 2015. The national agreement, which covers wages, job security, health and safety issues, will be combined with terms of the agreement on local issues at each plant to complete the contract for each location. Velez said Lyondell also canceled meetings during the 2015 strike.""It's not uncommon, but it's unacceptable,"" he said.During the rally, USW activist Joshua Lege used a bullhorn to speak to the workers, many of them wearing blue work coveralls as they lined up in front of the refinery.""They say they want peace and professionalism, but they want war,"" Lege said. The national contract covers about 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers. In September, union officials agreed to seek 8 percent annual wage increases and a 3-year contract in the coming negotiations. The contract would cover plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC)  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (N:HFC) and  Delek US Holdings Inc  (N:DK).

"By Stephanie Nebehay and Ryan WooGENEVA/BEIJING (Reuters) - The rapid rise in coronavirus raised fears of a pandemic on Friday, with five countries reporting their first cases, the World Health Organization warning it could spread worldwide and Switzerland cancelling the giant Geneva car show.World share markets crashed again, winding up their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis and bringing the global wipeout to $5 trillion. Hopes that the epidemic that started in China late last year would be over in months, and that economic activity would quickly return to normal, have been shattered as the number of international cases has spiraled.""The outbreak is getting bigger,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. ""The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.""Switzerland joined countries banning big events to try to curb the epidemic, forcing cancellation of next week's Geneva international car show, one of the industry's most important gatherings.The United States asked its military in Saudi Arabia to avoid crowded venues including malls and cinemas. Mainland China reported 327 new cases, the lowest since Jan. 23, taking its tally to more than 78,800 cases with almost 2,800 deaths. China's three biggest airlines restored some international flights and the Shanghai fashion show, initially postponed, went ahead online.TROOPS DEPLOYEDBut as the outbreak eases in China, it is surging elsewhere.Five more countries have reported their first case, all with travel history connected to Italy. They were Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, Netherlands and Lithuania, Lindmeier said.Countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.Bulgaria said it was ready to deploy up to 1,000 troops and military equipment to the border with neighboring Turkey to prevent illegal migrant inflows. It said it would not allow massive inflows at a time when it is stepping up preventive measures against the coronavirus. It has not reported any cases.Ratings agency Moody's said a pandemic - usually taken to mean a disease spreading quickly in different places - would trigger global and U.S. recessions in the first half of the year.Mongolia, which has yet to confirm a case, placed its president, Battulga Khaltmaa, in quarantine as a precaution after he returned from a trip to China, state media reported.A Chinese official called the epidemic the most difficult health crisis in the country's modern history. Another said some recovered patients had been found to be infectious, suggesting the epidemic may be even harder to eradicate than previously thought.Lindmeier said the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected.In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease.U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to expand production of protective gear.In Europe, France's reported cases doubled, Germany warned of an impending epidemic and Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East, announced tighter border controls.The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, rose to 17 and those testing positive increased by more than 200 to 655. Germany has nearly 60 cases, France about 38 and Spain 23, according to a Reuters count.Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a ""decisive point"" in efforts to prevent a wider outbreak, the WHO said.OLYMPIC DOUBTSSouth Korea has the most cases outside China.
