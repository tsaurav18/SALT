"TORONTO (Reuters) - Shares of Eldorado Gold rose as much as 14.6% on Monday on optimism that a snap poll called by Greece could result in the election of a new business-friendly party and help resolve permitting problems the miner has faced for years.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he would call a snap vote following his party's defeat in European Parliamentary elections to the opposition conservative New Democracy Party.Eldorado shares were up 13.7% at C$4.74 in afternoon trade in Toronto, compared with a 0.3% decline in the benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index. The stock earlier rose to the day's high of C$4.78.The Vancouver-based company has two operating mines and two development projects in Greece, and has struggled with permitting delays at its Skouries location for years, mainly over environmental regulations. The country accounts for 42% of Eldorado's operating net asset value, according to Desjardins.""A political shift to a more pro-business climate has potential positive implications for the company's outlook in-country,"" Josh Wolfson, an analyst at Desjardins, wrote in a note.Eldorado halted construction in November 2017 at Skouries, which has reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper, citing the delays. The company said in September it would seek 750 million euros ($839.03 million) from the government for damages it said it had suffered due to the delays.An Eldorado spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eldorado Chief Executive George Raymond Burns said on an analyst call in February that the company was ""feeling fairly optimistic that the election process could bring about a significant change in sentiment.""

"By Karen BrettellNEW YORK (Reuters) - A cash shortage that has plagued crucial overnight lending markets during the past few weeks is likely to flare back up heading into year-end, although measures taken by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity means the worst of the strains are probably over.The Fed began daily repurchase agreements in mid-September, after the repo rate for overnight loans surged to 10%, the highest since the financial crisis and far above the Fed’s then maximum fed funds target rate of 2.25%.The operations inject cash into the banking system, after demand for overnight loans from companies, banks and other borrowers overwhelmed supply.Analysts said the need to settle large amounts of Treasury issuance and cash needs from companies to pay taxes were factors behind the cash crunch.A reduction in excess bank reserves, cash held at the Fed that can be made available for loans, was also a large contributor, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in particular having cut the cash it holds on deposit at the Fed by 57% this year.The Fed's repo operations will run until at least January.Last week it also began purchasing Treasury bills, which will increase reserves in the system. When the Fed buys securities from a bank, it credits the bank’s reserve account.Analysts and market participants say these moves helped stabilize the market, where there are around $2.2 trillion in outstanding loans.But a jump in funding costs last week show that further bouts of volatility are likely to re-emerge. Banks and other large investors typically reduce risk-taking as they close their books for year-end, with fewer funds being made available for loans.“It’s a step in the right direction and it really does help to fundamentally address some of these issues of there being too few reserves in the banking system,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.That said, “I just don’t think that year-end is going to be particularly clean. I think that we will see some additional repo volatility.”The Fed began reducing its bond holdings in late 2017. Purchases after the financial crisis, known as quantitative easing, were designed to boost investment and economic growth.GRAPHIC: U.S. Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7722/7653/BalanceSheet.pngMORE STEPS NEEDEDTo reduce the risk of further disruptions, market participants say they expect more interventions from the Fed.One issue with the Fed’s purchases of Treasury bills is that money market funds are a major holder of the debt and will be reluctant to give it up, knowing that new purchases will come with lower returns.“Money funds just happen to be the largest owner and probably are not looking to sell, because whatever we reinvest would needless to say be lower than when we purchased it originally,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.Money market funds hold around 20% of the $2.25 trillion in outstanding Treasury bills, according to Fed data.Dealers own few bills compared to Fed demand. On average they have owned $22 billion in bills year-to-date, below the $60 billion the Fed plans to purchase each month, Cabana said.If the Fed’s purchases disrupt liquidity in the bill market, which could occur in the coming months, the Fed may expand purchases to short-dated Treasury notes, which would be easier to source, Cabana said.Dealers held $83 billion in notes with maturities up to three years this year, on average.GRAPHIC: U.S. primary dealers' Treasury holdings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7723/7654/PrimaryDealerHoldings.pngThe most important fix to ensure there is not a repeat of September, however, would be for the Fed to introduce a standing repo facility.The Fed has said it is looking at a permanent repo facility but has not yet committed to such a move.",0,0,

One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,"" CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in a statement.""Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.""The fund invests the proceeds from Norway's oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.It is one of the world's largest shareholders, with investments in around 9,100 companies worldwide, equivalent to 1.4 percent of listed companies globally.The fund's biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc (O:AAPL), worth 66 billion crowns, ahead of Nestle (S:NESN) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) at 50 billion.Apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund's returns in 2017, ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and Microsoft (O:MSFT).The fund's size is equivalent to $200,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.The government withdrew 61 billion Norwegian crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses, compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016.CEO Yngve Slyngstad earned an annual salary of 6.7 million crowns.

"By Sinéad Carew(Reuters) - Financial stocks have lagged the broader equity market since the start of the year and since the late March crisis-low. But not all stocks are created equal in the S&P index that tracks the industry, which is down 23% year-to-date. In fact, so far in 2020, the lead performers of the S&P 500 Financial sector (SPSY) have even outperformed the high-flying Nasdaq (IXIC), which is up almost 23% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is up 1%, and the Dow is down 7% for the year so far.The sector's wide performance disparity stems partly from low interest rates exposure versus trading exposure in a market that has risen sharply since March. Stocks that have performed well include exchanges, index companies or banks with trading desks or M&A advisory businesses and some insurance companies, said Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equities and portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). ""The ones relying on the yield curve and the short rates to make money have been more challenged,"" Dunn said, referring to banks that are mostly dependent on a steep yield curve to boost profits from their loan business. While many stocks in the sector are relatively cheap, some investors are wary of economic uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's suggestion it will keep rates low for a long time. ""If you expect the economy to grow and interest rates to start to rise, then banks are very compelling,"" said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. ""If the economy continues to grow and the Fed is successful at keeping rates very low you probably would be better off in exchanges and the banks that don't earn all their income from spread lending.""The leader of the financials pack is trading platform Marketaxess (O:MKTX) up 46% year-to-date, followed by MSCI (K:MSCI), up 32%, and then insurer Progressive (N:PGR), up 26%. In all, eight stocks in the index, which has more than 60 stocks, have shown double-digit percentage gains so far in 2020. Other outperformers include investment managers Blackrock Inc (N:BLK) and T Rowe Price (O:TROW) and stock exchanges, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE). Like MSCI, stock index company S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI) has also been in favor. On the other end of the spectrum,  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) was leading losses down 60%, followed by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s more than 48% year-to-date decline and Lincoln Nationals (N:LNC) roughly 44% drop.In all, 47 of the index's stocks have shown declines in the double-digit percentage range.Compared to the broader financial sector the bank subsector <.SPXBK> has fallen 37% so far this year while the insurance subsector <.SPXIN> has dropped 18%. While the financial index has risen almost 34% since the market's March 23 low, this gain compares with a 46% jump from the S&P 500, and an almost 43% gain for the Dow and a roughly 60% gain for Nasdaq.

"(Bloomberg) -- The latest collision between Italy’s markets and politics is beginning to fuel concern that shock waves could spread to elsewhere in Europe.As Italian bond yields climbed toward multi-year highs, the euro extended losses and the region’s equities slumped, while haven assets such as German bunds and the Swiss franc rallied.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned that the risk of a wider impact of the Italian turmoil has increased, even as markets in Spain and Portugal -- seen as a key barometer for any debt contagion to Europe’s periphery -- have so far shown little sign of anxiety.Budget official Claudio Borghi’s comments that the common currency is “not sufficient” to solve the country’s fiscal problems have rekindled worries that a breakup of the world’s largest trade bloc is still a possibility. He later denied that the country’s populist government had any plans to leave the euro.“European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy,” Goldman Sachs strategists led by Alessio Rizzi wrote in a research note. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen.”Markets were firmly in risk-off mode Tuesday, with demand rising for popular risk hedges. Italy’s two-year bonds took the brunt of the selling pressure, flattening the country’s yield curve. The cost of protection against a potential credit default by the nation rose and traders priced in a greater premium for three-month money-market borrowings over overnight loans.Euro, YieldsThe euro dropped by as much as 0.6 percent Tuesday to $1.1505, a six-week low. Italian 10-year yields climbed 14 basis points to 3.44 percent, re-testing a May 29 peak that was a four-year high. The spread over those on their German peers breached 300 basis points for the second time this year.Still, there’s little sign yet of a contagion effect across peripheral euro-area bonds. Ten-year yields in Spain and Portugal were little changed at 1.53 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively. Similar rates in Greece climbed nine basis points to 4.31 percent.The yield premium investors demand on benchmark Italian bonds over Spain has hit a seven-year high and is climbing toward a record 202 basis points reached in 2011. Strategists at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA including Jaime Costero expect the spread to widen further, as Spanish debt retains its appeal amid little spillover impact from Italy’s market volatility.“Political developments in Italy are still center-stage and will probably continue to remain the most critical driver for the euro for the time being,” analysts at UniCredit SpA wrote in a note. “Still, contained contagion in the bond markets implies that the budget talks are still perceived as a “local” issue. The market behavior suggests to us that the Italian developments are likely to just add “noise” to the common currency at the moment, but are not seen as grave enough to trigger a heavy sell-off.”‘Fade the Pop’Strategists at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA led by Valentin Marinov remain bullish on the euro as they see most of the Italy-related negativity already priced in, and with continued support from the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy normalization. Even as Italy’s bonds and stocks saw increased volatility in recent months as the country’s Five Star Movement-League coalition drew up their deficit targets, the shared currency had been relatively resilient.The Italian economy’s underlying strength may mean it’s time to ease out of risk-off hedges despite political risks, according to Mizuho International Plc.“The protection trades are ramping up,” head of European rates strategy Peter Chatwell said. But “this is a great opportunity for investors to fade the pop in some structures. Most obvious, to us, is to fade the rally in German bonds outright, as we do not think this flare-up between Italy and the EU will drag on the euro-area economy.”‘Sore Point’For others, Italy’s euroskeptic government is just the embodiment of the the populist sentiment taking root across Europe, which could threaten the bloc’s future and weigh on the euro for the months or even years to come.Borghi, head of Italy’s lower house budget committee and a well-known euroskeptic, said in an interview on Radio Anch’io that “Italy, with its own currency, would be able to resolve its problems.”“The comments about Italy having its own currency have touched a sore point,” said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank International. “While the return of the lira would be almost impossible and hugely inflationary even if it could happen, the fact that the remarks can be read as anti-EMU sentiment are worrisome.”",0,0,

"By Ginger GibsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, touted on Wednesday benefits he sees in federal government approval of T-Mobile US Inc's bid to acquire Sprint Corp, while also denying that he has worked directly for the company. Lewandowski said he remains in regular contact with the president and has daily contact with Trump's new campaign manager Brad Parscale. He has said he does not lobby on behalf of companies, but said he does consult with some corporations about navigating the federal government.""If the T-Mobile deal is going to move forward because it's going to create better 5G coverage in rural areas and create more jobs in the marketplace and help grow and compete with a competitive China, then without any hesitation I say we should have more jobs, we should be more competitive,"" Lewandowski said on Wednesday at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. ""I have no idea what the Justice Department does on it. I haven't spoken to anyone at the Justice Department on it.""U.S. antitrust enforcers have started reviewing T-Mobile's plan to buy Sprint for $26 billion, and have reached no conclusions on how many wireless carriers the country needs. The two companies compete against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon to provide U.S. wireless service. Lewandowski is among those advising the No. 3 wireless company on its deal as it prepares for what should be a tough regulatory review process, the mobile provider said in a statement in May. Lobbying by former Trump officials has received increased attention after it was made public that Michael Cohen, the president's former attorney, was paid $1.2 million by Novartis and $600,000 by AT&T to consult about the administration.It is not uncommon for former political officials to lobby and consult with corporations after leaving the employment of an elected official.A T-Mobile spokeswoman declined to comment on Lewandowski.Lewandowski insisted he simply shares office space with a lobbying shop, Turnberry Solutions LLC, which is advising T-Mobile. Lobbying disclosure reports show T-Mobile has paid Turnberry Solutions LLC $170,000 since September 2017. T-Mobile said in May that Lewandowski ""is now affiliated with (Turnberry) and they have offered perspective to T-Mobile on a variety of topics, including the pending transaction."" ""T-Mobile hired Jason Osborne and Mike Rubino, which is a firm that is also housed at the same office space that I am, and I talk to these guys all the time,"" Lewandowski said when asked why T-Mobile said he was consulting with them. ""I haven't made a phone call. I've never called a government employee or a person and asked them to look at, help, solicit, move forward, pass any transaction, and I would challenge anybody in the room to find someone in the government who said I called and asked for a favor because I've never done it.""

"By Hyunjoo JinULSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (KS:005380) union chief warned its workers may face a similar crisis to the one hitting General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit as sales in key markets slide, adding that electric cars were 'evil' and will destroy jobs.South Korea's auto industry, known for its robust unions whose workers tend to be paid more and have better benefits than their compatriots in other sectors, has come to a crossroads.Blaming high labor costs and falling sales, General Motors (N:GM) plans to close one of its plants in the country by May and is weighing options for its three other factories.""We're feeling job anxiety. We're feeling a sense of crisis,"" Ha Bu-young, the head of the  Hyundai Motor  union, South Korea's biggest and most powerful union, told Reuters in an interview late last week.He said that at three of Hyundai's five plants in Ulsan, the world's biggest car factory complex, some workers had been asked to take longer holidays as sales of sedans and older model SUVs like the Santa Fe slow in the United States and other markets.Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) were also hit by diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing last year, leading to a slump in sales in the world's biggest auto market. The two automakers have flagged only modest global sales growth in 2018.  Longer term, Ha worries about the advent of electric cars, which when they go mainstream could wreak havoc on traditional auto jobs as they don't require engines and transmissions. Hyundai's union has predicted a drastic shift into electric cars could lead to a loss of 70 percent of Hyundai jobs in a worst case scenario.""Electric cars are disasters. They are evil. We are very nervous,"" he said.Ha said the union is studying how cars of the future might be built without slashing headcount and has proposed the automaker revive a committee to review the impact of new vehicles and new technology on jobs.He also noted that some 30,000 workers out of 50,000 union members will retire in 15 years, which could cushion the impact that cars of the future could have on staffing levels.FREE TRIPS TO EUROPEAt GM's South Korean unit, the threat of potential plant closures has led its union to offer to freeze wages and skip bonuses while about 15 percent of its employees have applied for a voluntary redundancy package. While there is a sense of crisis at Hyundai's union, the situation is not that dire.Hyundai's management has proposed the scaling back of some benefits such as free week-long trips to Europe for 500 workers annually as well as support for some employees' sporting events - a proposal that the union plans to oppose, a union official said.But the union will for the first time seek pay raises for temporary workers this year that are higher than those of full-time auto workers, responding to criticism that regular auto works are generously paid. It will ask for a 7.4 percent wage increase for temporary workers versus a 5.3 percent wage raise for regular workers, Ha said, in line with a policy advocated by the umbrella union for South Korea's metal workers.Last year Hyundai's union initially demanded annual wage increases of 7 percent for its full-time workers and won a raise of less than 5 percent after tense negotiations that involved strikes.The shift towards improving pay for non-full time workers could invite opposition within the union, said Ha, adding that he was trying to right old wrongs.

"Investing.com - Markets are regaining some poise following sharp moves overnight after Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq fueled fears that the strikes would lead to an escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran. U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street, but Dow futures are weighed down by a drop in shares of Boeing in the wake of another deadly plane crash. Oil prices have trimmed back overnight gains but remain higher, while gold is holding near new seven-year highs. Here’s what you need to know to start your day.Market jitters eased on Wednesday following frenzied early trading after a rocket attack by Iran on U.S. forces in Iraq raised the specter of a spiraling Middle East conflict.Hopes grew the U.S. would stop short of strong retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ""All is well!"", and ""So far, so good!"".Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also tweeted that the Iranians ""do not seek escalation or war"".Iran's missile attack came early on Wednesday, hours after the funeral of an Iranian commander who was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week.U.S. stock futures clawed back their early steep losses, with the S&P 500 futures contract rising 10 points, or 0.3% by 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), while Nasdaq 100 futures rose a similar amount. But Dow futures struggled to make headway, weighed down by a drop in shares of Dow component Boeing (NYSE:BA) in premarket trade.Boeing shares were hit by news that a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 airliner burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash that an initial report blamed on engine failure.A spokesman for the manufacturer said it was gathering more information.The 737 does not have the software feature implicated in crashes of the 737 MAX. Boeing grounded its 737 MAX fleet in March after two crashes that killed 346 people.Investor demand for safe haven assets waned as the knee jerk reaction in markets to the Iran strikes unwound. Gold which earlier brushed through $1,600 an ounce, eased to $1,582.The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 1.811%, down from a U.S. close of 1.825% on Tuesday, but well off session lows around 1.705%.On currency markets, the attacks had sent the yen spiraling to three-month highs beyond 107.7 per dollar but gave up all those gains. Another safe-haven currency, the Swiss franc, also gave up gains.Oil prices were higher but gave up most of their early gains as fears over the prospect of supply disruptions in the Middle East receded.Global benchmark Brent crude was up 48 cents to $68.75 by 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), after earlier rising to their highest level since mid-September 2019 at $71.75.U.S. crude futures were last at $62.97, having earlier hit $65.85, the highest since late April last year.The Energy Information Administration is expected to report a drop of about 3.6 million barrels when it issues official stockpile numbers at 10:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.ADP employment figures are due out at 9:15 AM ET (14:15 GMT) ahead of Friday’s closely watched government nonfarm payrolls report for December.Economists are predicting a rise of 160,000 in payrolls for the month, up from the tepid rise of 67,000 seen in November.The market is looking for about the same rise for nonfarm payrolls when the Labor Department weighs in with official figures.--Reuters contributed to this report",1,2,
"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday it would recall 1.2 million Honda and Acura vehicles in North America to replace defective Takata airbags on the driver's side.The company said https://hondanews.com/channels/corporate-recalls/releases/statement-by-american-honda-regarding-recall-of-takata-desiccated-replacement-driver-front-airbag-inflators it was aware of one injury linked to the defect, which may have caused the airbag to rupture when it was deployed in a crash.Of the 23 total deaths worldwide linked to faulty Takata airbags, 21 have occurred in Honda vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the recall covers 1.1 million U.S. vehicles and is to replace inflators received ""either as a permanent Takata airbag inflator recall replacement or as a service part installed following a crash or problem with the airbag itself.""Another 100,000 vehicles are being recalled in Canada, Mexico and Central America, Honda said.The Honda models being recalled include 2001-2007 and 2009 Honda Accord, 2001-2005 Honda Civic, 2002-2007 and 2010-2011 Honda CR-V, 2003-2011 Honda Element, 2007 Honda Fit, 2002-2004 Honda Odyssey, 2003-2008 Honda Pilot, and 2006-2014 Honda Ridgeline.The Acura models include 2003 Acura 3.2CL, 2013-2016 Acura ILX, 2003-2006 Acura MDX, 2002-2003 Acura 3.2TL, 2004-2006 and 2009-2014 Acura TL, 2007-2016 Acura RDX, and 2010-2013 Acura ZDX.More than 290 injuries worldwide have been linked to Takata inflators that could explode, spraying metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In total, 19 automakers are recalling more than 100 million potentially faulty inflators worldwide.Repairs of the recalled Hondas and Acuras will begin immediately in the United States with replacement parts made by alternate suppliers, Honda said.Honda became aware of the issue after a Honda Odyssey crash, where the front airbag deployed and injured the driver's arm. An investigation later showed that manufacturing issues at Takata's Mexico facility introduced excessive moisture into the inflator during assembly, leading to the problem.The total number of recalled inflators is now about 21 million in about 12.9 million Honda and Acura vehicles that have been subject to recall for replacing Takata front airbag inflators in the United States, the company said.Automakers in the United States repaired more than 7.2 million defective Takata air bag inflators in 2018, as companies have ramped up efforts to track down parts in need of replacement.

"Investing.com - Shares in GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank in pre-market trade on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the firm and cut its price target.Specifically, these analysts cut their recommendation on the action camera maker to “underweight” from “equal-weight” while reducing the price target to $5 from the prior $9.50.Although GoPro managed to return to profitability at the end of 2017, these experts think that that investors may be giving the firm “too much credit”.Morgan Stanley admitted that its prior recommendation on the company was “too generous”, especially now that the holiday season is over and the firm cut prices on its latest HERO6 camera due to competition.These analysts believe that the only way for GoPro to boost demand for its products is by improving the underlying software and that negative trends seen last year will likely weigh on products both this year and next.Shares of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) slumped 6.03% to $5.92 in pre-market trade Tuesday.",0,0,
"By Jessica DiNapoliNEW YORK (Reuters) - A video of 95-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch of the family that owns the voting majority of CBS Corp (N:CBS), can be reviewed in the U.S. broadcast and media company's legal battle against the family, a Delaware judge ruled on Wednesday.Redstone, however, will not be required to give testimony, the judge decided.National Amusements Inc, the Redstone family's holding company, and CBS are in the midst of a high-stakes legal dispute over control of the company and its potential merger with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), also majority-owned by NAI. Shari Redstone, the daughter of Sumner, has pushed to combine Viacom with CBS.The health and mental faculties of Sumner Redstone, the founder and chairman emeritus of Viacom, and the majority owner of NAI, are a flashpoint for dispute in the battle for control. ""We are very pleased with the court's ruling today, which will now allow us to conduct appropriate discovery from National Amusements on the issue of who controls NAI,"" CBS said in a statement, adding that the video of Redstone would be kept confidential. National Amusements declined to comment.  CBS had pushed to have the tape, which could end up as evidence in the trial, included for review, while NAI has previously said that the recording broke California law because Redstone did not know he was being filmed.The contents of the video have not been made public. A source with knowledge of the situation said the video was taken by a CBS board member, is several minutes long and shows Sumner Redstone's physical and mental state.National Amusements must produce certain documents requested by CBS, according to court filings. CBS said it will also be able to secure National Amusements' documents relating to the 2016 ousting of five Viacom directors, including then-CEO Philippe Dauman.The CBS board had approved a dividend earlier this year that would dilute the Redstone family's majority voting rights in the company, in an attempt to prevent the merger with Viacom.

"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) estimate it will post a record $13 billion full-year loss, dragged down by its spluttering $100 billion Vision Fund, has renewed attention on a planned asset sell-down aimed at raising cash and restoring confidence.SoftBank shares fell as much as 4% on Tuesday before recovering to close up 5% after the group late on Monday said it sees a 1.8 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) full-year loss at the Vision Fund as its tech bets crumble.The disastrous performance at the fund on which Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has staked his reputation will drag the entire group to its largest annual loss, underscoring the need for his plan to raise up to 4.5 trillion yen through asset sales.While domestic carrier SoftBank Corp (T:9434) is seen as a possible target, SoftBank is dependent on its dividends for cash flow, leaving its stake in  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) the most likely to be sold down or monetized, UBS analyst Kei Takahashi wrote in a client note.SoftBank's biggest asset, its 26% stake in the Chinese e-commerce leader, has already been used as collateral to borrow more than a trillion yen, with collar transactions contributing a further 200 billion at the end of December.The Alibaba stake could be used to raise 3 trillion yen, Takahashi wrote, along with using its stake in wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), which just completed a merger with SoftBank's Sprint, as collateral for loans.The move comes as SoftBank is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management to improve shareholder returns, with the group announcing a share buyback of up to 2.5 trillion yen. The rise in SoftBank's shares on Tuesday followed comments from the Japan Credit Rating Agency which said the impact of the expected annual loss on SoftBank's credit rating is limited as it will not greatly affect debt ratios.OPAQUESoftBank's willingness to leverage its investments adds to a lack of transparency around its finances, contributing to its persistent conglomerate discount.

"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) said on Thursday its current-quarter revenue and profit would take a hit from supply chain disruptions and weak demand due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, the consumer goods company's second-biggest market.The epidemic, which originated in China's Hubei province and has claimed more than 2,000 lives, has raised concerns on its economic fallout stretching further into 2020, as companies have been forced to shut stores and curtail manufacturing in the critical market.The company's supply side has come under pressure, as it relies on 387 suppliers in China that ship more than 9,000 different materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished product items.""Each of these suppliers faces their own challenges in resuming operations,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference.P&G also said store traffic was considerably down in China and had fallen in other Asian countries as well.""Some of the demand has shifted online, but supply of delivery operators and labor is limited,"" Moeller added.The company, which reaffirmed its full-year targets, did not provide financial estimates for the hit it would take in the quarter ending March.",0,0,
"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base.Carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. To avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, Daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels.Daimler's suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire Mercedes-Benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. ""Due to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that Daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,"" the carmaker said in its annual report. ""This could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. If suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,"" Daimler said.""Necessary capacity expansion at suppliers' plants could also require cost-effective participation,"" Daimler added.Daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing Daimler to step in. Daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.In its annual report, Daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices.""Generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,"" the annual report said.Daimler's report, published on Tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier.The Stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings.Daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States in a class-action suit which alleges the German carmaker used software to reduce emissions.Daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed.Among the legal risks faced by Daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. Daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities.Daimler also said in its report that Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche's total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier.

"By Aishwarya Venugopal(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) beat expectations for earnings and raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday as its investments in same-day delivery and pick-up services increased traffic to its website and stores, sending shares 19% higher.The retailer has spent billions of dollars on its push to compete with the ease of delivery provided by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, buying grocery delivery firm Shipt, and building in-store pickup and drive-up services.Target said one out of five customers who used its same-day service in the quarter were new, with shoppers collecting their orders from stores within a couple of minutes of placing them through the company's mobile app or website.""Q2 could not have gone better for Target,"" Charlie O'Shea, a vice president at ratings agency Moody's, said of the results.Led since 2014 by retail-industry veteran Brian Cornell, Target has bounced back from a slide three years ago which saw its margins drop, prompting a rethink that has seen it remodel hundreds of stores each year since. Like Walmart it has refitted its business to deal with the challenge presented by Amazon and other online retailers, also developing its line of own-brand goods to boost profits.Wednesday's results showed the company's same-day services drove more than three-fourths of a 34% increase in comparable digital sales in the quarter. Those online sales accounted for more than half of its total same-store sales. ""Because these options leverage our store infrastructure, technology and teams, same-day fulfillment delivers outstanding financial performance as well,"" Cornell told a post earnings call.The company's stock, which had already risen 29% this year, jumped 19% to a record high of $102.02, driving gains in other retail players and adding to broad gains for Wall Street. NO MARGIN SLIPThe quicker deliveries, Target executives said, also powered profitability as margins expanded for the first time in nearly three years, rising 30 basis points to 30.6% in the quarter. That reflected a stronger product mix and optimization of pricing, the company said, at a time when Walmart's margins dropped 46 basis points. Macy's, Kohl's and J.C. Penney have all reported disappointing results in the past week.""While many department store peers struggle to sustain positive traffic and stable gross margins, Target is finding the right balance,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.Target's comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3.4% as demand for apparel, toys and beauty products rose. Late in the quarter, the retailer also benefited from back-to-school promotions.Its strategy of opening smaller locations in college towns and urban areas, and stocking more own-brand goods, helped store traffic grow 2.4%.Earlier this week, the company said it was starting a new food and beverage brand, Good & Gather, that would hit stores in September. Target expects full-year adjusted profit to be between $5.90 and $6.20 per share, up from the prior range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share. The outlook accounted for potential additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.Excluding certain items, it earned $1.82 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 20 cents. Total revenue rose 3.6% to $18.42 billion, above expectations of $18.34 billion. ",1,1,
"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- How do you trade an election campaign? is a bit like the old joke about how hedgehogs make love - ""very carefully."" The sad truth is that investors' yearning for certainty is likely to be no more than half-satisfied, even in the most likely scenario.True, the U.K. market outperformed the rest of Europe again on Tuesday, with the FTSE 100 rising 0.1% and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 midcap index rising 0.3%. That’s another tentative sign that investors are turning more positive on what has been the world’s most despised asset class for most of the last four years. The reason? Confidence – at least a relative degree of it – that the Dec. 12 election will produce a Conservative majority in parliament, breaking the deadlock on Brexit and banishing the risk of a hard-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn.Skeptics who argue that a Tory majority has its own risks overlook the increasingly debilitating effect of this endless uncertainty over Brexit. Data out Tuesday showed U.K. mortgage approvals fell to their lowest in seven months, and the Bank of England earlier this month identified the “domestic impact of Brexit-related uncertainties” as one of the chief reasons for a “material” slowdown in the U.K. this year. But the U.K. is still the worst performing market in Europe both this year and on a three-year view, for good reason.A Conservative majority – to which most U.K. bookmakers ascribe a probability between 60%-70%, would almost certainly lead to the country formally leaving the European Union within a month or two. That would finally rule out the prospect of remaining, which the overwhelming majority of economic analysis suggests is the most positive for the U.K.’s long-term economic future. It would not, however, settle the degree to which the U.K. would remain aligned with the EU. Here too, the government’s own analysis sees big variations in long-term economic outcomes, with the most favorable – close alignment with the EU’s standards and trade policy – at odds with a political dynamic pushing for a more distant relationship. By contrast, a Conservative defeat would most likely lead to a hung parliament and a second referendum - another few months of uncertainty in which the optimal long-run outcome is kept alive, but with no guarantee of success.Jim O’Neill, chairman of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said on Tuesday that any relief rally in U.K. assets on the back of a Conservative election win would soon run into headwinds “by February or March”, because the proposed transitional period following Brexit is still set to expire at the end of 2020. That leaves the U.K. with no time to negotiate a comprehensive trading arrangement with the EU.But while the top-down analysis is inevitably still gloomy, the bottom-up effects are much rosier. Individual stocks such as utilities would have the risk of renationalization removed, and all domestic-consumption themed stocks would logically seem poised to benefit from the big increase in budget spending that the Tories are promising to cushion the Brexit blow.The bottom line: nothing is certain, and everything is possible. Nice if you like to trade risk, but still a horrendous backdrop for seeking long-term value.",0,0,

"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A recovery rally in European stocks gathered pace for a second day on Thursday after investors brushed off a spike in U.S. inflation, turning their focus back to company earnings from heavy hitters including Europe's largest aerospace firm, Airbus.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.8 percent by 0933 GMT, hitting its highest level in a week. The main European stock index was still down 6.5 percent from its 2 1/2-year peak hit as recently as Jan. 23.Cyclical sectors drove the market higher, with basic resources, industrials, banks and technology stocks the best performers, recovering from their sharp drop last week.The rapid recovery from a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation reported on Wednesday took some by surprise, and investors said the bounce back indicated underlying strength in the market. ""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.""Earnings took center stage once more, with strong results driving the top gainers Airbus,  Ipsen  (PA:IPN),  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).Airbus (PA:AIR) shares jumped 8.8 percent after Europe's largest aerospace firm beat profit and earnings expectations, though it booked a new 1.3 billion euro charge on its A400M military plane.Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) was a top CAC 40 gainer, up 5 percent after the electrical equipment producer reported a strong profit margin despite headwinds from the rise in the euro.Shares in Dutch insurer Aegon (AS:AEGN) gained 3.7 percent after the firm reported a doubling of quarterly net income and raised estimates for future earnings, thanks to a tax cut in the U.S. where it does around 60 percent of its business.Insurer  NN Group  (AS:NN) fared less well than its rival Aegon. The Dutch firm's shares fell 3 percent after it reported profit undershooting analysts' expectations. Another notable faller was Nestle (S:NESN) whose shares hit a 10-month low, down 2.4 percent after the Swiss food giant reported last year's organic growth was the weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996.Meanwhile bank and insurance firm  Old Mutual  (L:OML), and mining company  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose to the top of Britain's FTSE 100 after President Jacob Zuma resigned in South Africa, sending the rand to near three-year highs.Both firms derive a high proportion of their revenue in South Africa, where the parliament was set to confirm Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president later on Thursday.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm, embroiled in an accounting scandal, said it would hold its annual shareholders' meeting on April 20.Overall fourth-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the previous year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.""Earnings estimates have also been raised, so that's definitely one of the supporting factors of the rally,"" said Robeco's Daalder.

"ROME (Reuters) - Rome's Fiumicino airport will run COVID-tested flights to and from the United States operated by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Alitalia, it said on Thursday, adding it will be the first airport in Europe to offer the service on transatlantic flights.From December, passengers flying between Rome and some U.S. destinations can be tested for the coronavirus 48 hours before departure and on arrival at the airport, to avoid the mandatory 14-day quarantine Italy imposes on incoming travellers.Aeroporti di Roma (ADR), the unit of Italian infrastructure group Atlantia that runs Fiumicino airport, said the new protocol will be valid for those flying from New York JFK, Newark and Atlanta.In a separate statement, Delta Air Lines said it would reopen its routes between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, in Georgia, and Rome on Dec. 19 to those travelling for work, health or study reasons.""Carefully designed COVID-19 testing protocols are the best path for resuming international travel safely and without quarantine until vaccinations are widely in place,"" said Steve Sear, Delta President – International and Executive Vice President - Global Sales.Fiumicino saw its passenger traffic plummet this year due to the coronavirus crisis and early in March it was forced to announce a partial closure.In September, in an effort to resume domestic travel after the first wave of the epidemic, Italian carrier Alitalia experimented with COVID testing on some flights between Rome Fiumicino and Milan city airport Linate, Italy's biggest hubs.However, the government progressively restricted movement between regions to tackle a second wave of infections and Milan is currently under a partial lockdown.The Italian government is expected to give the go-ahead to COVID-tested U.S. flights in the coming days, ADR said, adding that the government's official backing will also allow them to offer such flights between Rome and Munich, and Rome and Frankfurt in Germany. ",1,1,
"By Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese mobility venture has unveiled two adapted vans, one which can serve as a workspace or a mobile shop, and another that pumps fresh air through the vehicle to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading between passengers. It is the first commercial offering from Monet, a joint venture between SoftBank Corp (T:9434) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). In one version, the adapted Toyota Hiace van takes in outside air and circulates it through the interior, which is also fitted with screens and curtains to limit virus transmission. It can seat eight passengers in the back. The other version of the van allows users to fix fittings to the floor and arrange the interior as a shop or work space.The Monet joint venture was first announced in October 2018 with the goal of becoming a platform for driverless services. Neither design incorporates self-driving technology and, in the case of the multi-purpose design, Japan's road rules require fittings such as tables to be stored before moving off. The venture hopes to sell 100 units in Japan to customers from government and companies this financial year. Monet is the first alliance between Japan's largest automaker and its No.3 wireless carrier and has attracted support from other domestic automakers as the industry races to develop autonomous vehicles and services.

"By Daina Beth SolomonMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed used-car platform Kavak has become Mexico's first tech ""unicorn"" after reaching a $1.15 billion valuation in its latest funding round last month, Chief Executive Carlos Garcia told Reuters.The Mexico City-based startup has raised over $400 million in total funding since its founding four years ago, with Japan's SoftBank, Hong Kong's DST Global and U.S.-based Greenoaks Capital leading the recent round, Garcia said in an interview on Wednesday.The company is SoftBank's most recent Latin American investment to become a unicorn - lingo for tech startups valued at more than $1 billion - after delivery app Loggi and gym membership app Gympass, both from Brazil, and Colombian delivery app Rappi.Japanese tech investor Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) last year vowed to deploy $5 billion in the region, which Mexican investors praised as a potential game changer for young companies that struggle to fundraise locally.""It's really humbling for us to be the first Mexican unicorn. It's something really important for the ecosystem in Latin America, and especially Mexico,"" Garcia, 37, said.Kavak, an online platform for buying and selling secondhand cars with operations in Mexico and Argentina, is laying plans to launch in Brazil early next year, Garcia said.Kavak entered Argentina in August through its merger with used-car platform Checkars.After building the business gradually in Mexico, Garcia said he aims to scale up faster in Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, with plans to hire 500 people within a year. Kavak employs some 800 people in Mexico and Argentina, a workforce that Garcia says will nearly double next year.Despite the hit of the coronavirus crisis, Garcia said traffic has recovered to pre-pandemic levels as shoppers become more comfortable with e-commerce and seek alternatives to public transportation.He expects Kavak to turn a profit in the next couple of years, and going public is in his sights, too.""A route to do an IPO is in our plans... probably in the next two to three years we'd think about doing that,"" he said. ",1,1,

"By Tim Hepher and Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 exactly three years ago. France's BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada. The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 metres below the surface and just a metre away from a hidden crevasse.The probe focused on the fan hub at the centre of a 3-metre-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:RTX).The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators - the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency - to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes.""Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,"" the BEA said.Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight. Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce (L:RR).A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part ""cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service"".Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures. The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure. In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue.During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report.At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's telecoms companies could be fined up to 10% of turnover or 100,000 pounds ($133,140) a day if they contravene a ban on using equipment made by China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd under a new law put forward on Tuesday.The Telecommunications (Security) Bill will boost the security standards of the UK's telecoms networks and remove the threat of high-risk vendors, the government said.Britain in July decided to ban the use of Huawei in 5G networks from the end of 2027 because of concerns that U.S. sanctions on chip technology meant the Chinese company would not be a reliable supplier.The bill aims to enshrine that decision in law and manage any risks from other high-risk vendors in the future, with tough penalties for telecom companies that break the rules.Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the benefits of 5G and fibre networks could only be realised if they were secure and resilient.""This groundbreaking bill will give the UK one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world and allow us to take the action necessary to protect our networks,"" he said.Huawei said it was disappointed that the government was looking to exclude it from the roll-out of 5G.""This decision is politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks,"" said Vice President Victor Zhang.""It does not serve anyone's best interests as it would move Britain into the digital slow lane and put at risk the Government's levelling up agenda.""The government said the tougher security standards in the bill would also help protect Britain from potential cyber attacks from countries and criminals.Regulator Ofcom will be given the duty of monitoring and assessing the security of telecoms providers.

"By Katanga Johnson(Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc has agreed to pay a $180 million penalty to settle accounting fraud charges for ""intentionally and materially"" overstating its 2019 revenue and understating a net loss, U.S. regulators said on Wednesday.The U.S. Securities and Commission (SEC) fine on the China-based rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) comes after it said earlier this year that much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, sending its shares plunging and sparking an investigation by China's securities regulator and the SEC. The SEC said it found that Luckin ""intentionally and materially overstated its reported revenue and expenses and materially understated its net loss in its publicly disclosed financial statements in 2019.""Luckin has not admitted or denied the charges, the SEC said. The company has agreed to pay the penalty, which may be offset by certain payments it makes to its security holders in connection with its provisional liquidation proceeding in the Cayman Islands.“This settlement with the SEC reflects our cooperation and remediation efforts, and enables the company to continue with the execution of its business strategy,” Dr. Jinyi Guo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Luckin Coffee said in a statement.“The Company’s Board of Directors and management are committed to a system of strong internal financial controls, and adhering to best practices for compliance and corporate governance,” Guo added.The transfer of funds to the security holders will be subject to approval by Chinese authorities.""Public issuers who access our markets, regardless of where they are located, must not provide false or misleading information to investors,"" SEC Director of Enforcement Stephanie Avakian said in a statement.""While there are challenges in our ability to effectively hold foreign issuers and their officers and directors accountable to the same extent as U.S. issuers and persons, we will continue to use all our available resources to protect investors when foreign issuers violate the federal securities laws,"" she said.Founded in June 2017, Luckin had one of the most successful U.S. IPOs by a Chinese company last year, attracting interest from prominent U.S. investors, including long-only funds and hedge funds.But Luckin said in early April that as much as 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million) in sales last year were fabricated by its Chief Operating Officer Jian Liu and other staff, who had been suspended while the company carried out its investigation.The falsified numbers equate to about 40% of Luckin’s annual sales projected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.The Xiamen-headquartered company, which delisted from Nasdaq at the end of June due to the accounting scandal, used related parties to create false sales transactions through three separate purchasing schemes, the SEC alleged.""Luckin employees attempted to conceal the fraud by inflating the company’s expenses by more than $190 million, creating a fake operations database, and altering accounting and bank records to reflect the false sales,"" the agency found.Further, the SEC alleges that during the period of the fraud, Luckin raised more than $864 million from debt and equity investors.

"You might not yet have heard the name Mene (Vancouver: MENE), but you could soon enough, especially if you’re in the market for fine jewelry, explains Frank Holmes, CEO & chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors and editor of Frank Talk.Founded in 2017 by Roy Sebag, co-founder of gold financial services firm Goldmoney, and Diana Widmaier-Picasso, granddaughter of — you guessed it —Pablo Picasso, Mene’s mission is to disrupt the gold jewelry market by selling directly to the consumer and pricing its merchandise fairly and transparently.Unlike traditional sellers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Cartier, which sometimes have high premiums, Mene prices its jewelry based on the changing value of gold.It then charges a 15 percent to 20 percent design and production fee on top of that. What also sets the company apart is that its jewelry—from earrings to necklaces, bracelets to charms—is made of 24-karat gold or platinum. No alloys, no insets of diamonds or other stones.That’s done to help the pieces retain their value over time. Here at U.S. Global Investors, we believe gold is money and a timeless investment. Mene, which takes its name from the Aramaic word for “money,” has clearly run with that idea, going so far as to trademark the phrase “investment jewelry.”It’s a business model that seems to have resonated with consumers and investors alike. In its first 10 months of operation, Mene did as much as $7 million in sales in more than 53 countries, as of October 2018.Subscribe to Frank Holmes's Frank Talk here…",1,1,

"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Saumya Joseph(Reuters) - Amag Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:AMAG), whose shares have tumbled more than 45% in the past year, on Tuesday agreed to add two directors proposed by Caligan Partners after the hedge fund pressured the drugmaker to conduct a strategic business review.Amag, which won U.S. approval for a female libido drug in June, said it will expand its board to 11 people, making room for Caligan Partners' founder David Johnson and Paul Fonteyne, a former head of Boehringer Ingelheim USA.The hedge fund, which owns a 10.3% stake in Amag, had for months been pressing for changes ranging from cost cuts to possibly splitting up the company or finding partnerships, and had proposed adding four new directors to the board.Camber Capital Management, Amag's second largest shareholder, also pushed for new board members.

"By Sharon BernsteinSACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present.In a report to state regulators https:// PG&E said it would also remove 375,000 trees near electricity lines, trim vegetation over 2,500 square miles (6,475 square km) and conduct thousands of inspections to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.PG&E is under intense scrutiny for its role in sparking more than a dozen wildfires over the past two years. It filed bankruptcy last month, citing anticipated liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off November's deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people. The San Francisco-based utility, which serves 16 million customers, said it would increase nearly tenfold its efforts to turn off the power to communities threatened by wildfire, increasing the number of households and businesses potentially affected by fire-prevention blackouts in 2019 to 5.4 million.Such shutoffs were also used last year to keep live electricity in the lines from setting off a fire when high winds and heat hit extreme levels and nearby brush or trees could be ignited. Mark Toney, who directs the utility consumer advocacy group the Utility Reform Network (TURN), said shutting off power would harm vulnerable people, including those who rely on electricity to power life-saving medical equipment.""The fact that there is such a dramatic expansion of power shutoffs as a strategy to stop wildfires is a sign of PG&E’s failure and mismanagement when it comes to trimming the trees and taking care of the grid,"" he said.PG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said the company would only turn off the power to a community as a last resort to keep people safe.""We understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects the operation of critical facilities, communications systems and much more,"" she said.The company is also on probation in relation to a criminal conviction in the deadly 2010 explosion of one of its natural gas lines in the city of San Bruno near San Francisco.The judge in that case said he would consider the company's wildfire plan in deciding whether PG&E should do more to prevent wildfire. California law requires all investor-owned utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans annually. ",1,2,
"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). is adding 400 workers, some of whom will transfer from plants that are at risk of shutting down, to its Chevrolet Corvette factory in Kentucky that’s preparing to produce the next-generation sports car.The largest U.S. automaker will reveal the Corvette on July 18, according to a statement Thursday. GM will be making the jobs available to existing employees, including those from plants that the company has said won’t be allocated new product, according to Pat Morrissey, a spokesman.GM has been taking political heat from the likes of President Donald Trump and Democratic candidates to challenge him, including former Vice President Joe Biden, over plans to stop production at four U.S. plants by early next year. GM’s Chevrolet Cruze factory in Lordstown, Ohio, which is about 500 miles from the Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, stopped operating in March.All 3,000 workers who will be displaced from their current jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio due to the restructuring will be offered transfers to other GM plants, Morrissey said. The Corvette plant probably will be able to fill all 400 jobs with transferring workers, he said.UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who has publicly criticized GM for not adding new products to Lordstown and three other plants, commended the automaker for adding work at the Corvette plant.“We hope to see more of this in the future from GM, which is good for our members, their families, the community, and all of America,” Dittes said.The new Corvette will be the eighth generation of the famed sports car, which began in 1953.(Updates with hiring detail in the fourth paragraph.)",1,2,
"By Geert De ClercqPARIS (Reuters) - Since its start as a grocery pushcart, the Fauchon delicatessen has been on the same spot in central Paris for 134 years where it was buffeted by two World Wars, countless mass demonstrations, strikes and riots. Now Fauchon, famous for its eclairs, foie gras, truffles, and fine wines, is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic which has robbed Paris of most of its tourism trade and struck when the store's footfall was already weakened by months of social unrest.In June, Fauchon put its two flagship stores on Place de la Madeleine into receivership and submitted a restructuring plan to court, which will rule by Sept. 15. ""All demonstrations in Paris seem to start or finish at La Madeleine, and each time we need to close shop. Then there were the strikes around Christmas, our peak period, then came Covid, which was the final blow,"" Fauchon executive Justine Klar said.The firm has warned its 107 staff at La Madeleine there will be job cuts and is negotiating redundancy terms with unions. Fauchon hopes to move to cheaper premises in Paris, away from the demonstrations circuit and to focus more on a Parisian clientele than on tourists. It also wants to boost its network of 73 franchises in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, which are not impacted by the receivership.Founded in 1886 by a pushcart fruit and vegetable grocer named Auguste Fauchon, the store is one of several Paris luxury food brands with 19th century roots. Like macaron shop Laduree, hot chocolate specialist Angelina and gourmet traiteur Maxim's, Fauchon competes with LVMH-owned market leader La Grande Epicerie. Fauchon said that even if its food outlets will likely move, its luxury hotel is doing well and will stay at La Madeleine.""La Madeleine was the cradle for Fauchon, so it is very important for us to maintain a presence here,"" she said.

"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Airlines are set to lose $84 billion as the coronavirus pandemic reduces revenue by half to mark the worst year in the sector's history, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast on Tuesday.

""Every day of this year will add $230 million to industry losses,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said. The average loss amounts to almost $38 per passenger flown.In 2021, IATA warned losses could hit $100 billion as traffic struggles to recover and airlines slash fares to win business.""Airlines will still be financially fragile in 2021,"" De Juniac said, predicting ""even more intense"" competition.""That will translate into strong incentives for travellers to take to the skies again,"" he added.IATA forecast a rise in 2021 revenue to $598 billion.Airlines are counting the cost of weeks of lost business, a debt pile swollen by bailouts and a diminished demand outlook.Passenger numbers are seen falling to 2.25 billion this year before rising to 3.38 billion in 2021, still more than 25% below 2019 levels.Yields, a proxy for fares, are seen falling 18% this year, contributing to a $241 billion decline in passenger revenue.Cargo, a relatively small share of the overall business, brought some relief as mass plane groundings drove price increases expected to top 30%, IATA said, helping revenue to a near-record $111 billion.Even in markets where COVID-19 infection rates have fallen sharply, airlines still face a patchwork of travel restrictions and wary consumers.A 14-day quarantine for arriving passengers introduced by Britain this week has prompted an angry response and legal threats from the travel industry amid reports that it may be loosened in favour of ""air corridors"" to some destinations.

"By Rebecca Spalding(Reuters) - A group representing some of the largest U.S. employers has asked Congress for a year-long ban on mergers and acquisitions among hospitals and doctors groups that received government money to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pacific Business Group on Health, whose members include Boeing (NYSE:BA), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), said in a letter addressed to congressional leaders this week that it feared that further consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to higher costs.Physician practices’ revenues have plummeted across the United States since shutdowns were imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as patients stay home except for emergencies. Even before the pandemic, well-funded hospital systems were taking over smaller doctors groups and hospitals to increase market share.PBGH said it fears these larger players will be even better positioned to buy struggling practices coming out of the crisis, raising healthcare prices for employers. The group asked for a year-long M&A ban for any healthcare provider receiving any of the $170 billion government relief approved for the industry. ""Anti-competitive practices are increasingly concerning to large employers. What we’re seeing happening right now is the collapse of independent primary care,"" Elizabeth Mitchell, chief executive officer of PBGH, told Reuters.Politicians and regulators have already been scrutinizing mergers in the hospital industry.

A lawyer for the Paris-based company could not immediately be located.Levi said it has put distinctive tabs bearing its name, in the form of folded cloth ribbons, in the seams of its pants pockets since 1936, to provide ""sight identification"" for its products.It said Kenzo has not complied with its cease-and-desist letters to stop selling its own clothing bearing similar tabs, including in its ""Kenzo presents Britney Spears-La Collection Memento No. 2"" line launched last month.The complaint quoted Leo Christopher Lucier, Levi's national sales manager in 1936, as having said ""no other maker of overalls can have any other purpose in putting a colored tab on an outside patch pocket, unless for the express and sole purpose of copying our mark, and confusing the customer.""Levi is seeking to recoup lost profits, compensatory and punitive damages, and halt further infringements.The case is Levi Strauss & Co v Kenzo Paris USA LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02106.

"By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) stock rose to its highest in nearly three years on Wednesday after chief executive Tim Hoettges looked forward to a potentially massive unlocking of value in a U.S. investment that has languished for years.The decision earlier this month by a New York District Court removing the last obstacles to the merger of its T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) unit with Sprint (NYSE:S) has transformed the investment case for that unit and, in doing so, has materially improved the investment case for the parent.Instead of being the permanently-squeezed fourth-largest player in the U.S., aggressively discounting to gain market share, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is now going to be comparable in size to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), with enhanced pricing power in a market dominated by three large players rather than four (at least, that’s the logic: Telekom’s margins in Germany haven't improved much since a similar concentration resulting from Vodafone’s acquisition of Liberty Global’s local assets).After years of waiting for the merger to be cleared, investors have largely forgotten that story. According to Reuters, Hoettges said the 'new' T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion, less than half the value of either of the big two.""That is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,"" Hoettges said in prepared remarks.The German giant is set to have 42% of the new T-Mobile/Sprint venture. Even at a more conservative valuation of $200 billion, that would still imply an equity value of $84 billion for DT’s share – more than Telekom's entire market capitalization at today’s prices. Even allowing for the high cost of building out 5G networks in both the U.S. and Europe, and even allowing for the fact that net debt, at 2.65 times EBITDA, is still above AT&T’s, it would seem churlish not to ascribe any value to Telekom’s non-U.S. business. In the year just finished, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow were all clearly higher. Stripped of one-off factors, the bottom line grew by 8.9% percent to 4.9 billion euros ($5.3 billion). A dividend yield of 3.6% is respectable enough, even if slower core earnings growth ahead leaves little promise of big increases.Telekom has been the slowest of slow burners for many years. Even now, the stock is still short of its 2017 peak and below where it was as far back as 2004. But with the road ahead of T-Mobile finally clear, the prospects look as good as at any time in that period.",1,1,
"(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. retreated to a four-month low in Hong Kong after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on China’s largest chipmaker.The shares slumped as much as 7.9% on Monday, adding to their 25% loss for the month. Also listed in Shanghai, SMIC’s stock there retreated as much as 5.8% to the lowest level since its July debut. U.S. firms must now apply for a license to export certain products to the chipmaker, the Commerce Dept. said in a letter dated Sept. 25, reviewed by Bloomberg News. SMIC and its subsidiaries present “an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end use,” the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security wrote.Read more: U.S. Imposes Restrictions on Exports to China’s Top ChipmakerThe U.S. stopped short of placing SMIC on the so-called entity list, which means the restrictions are not yet as severe as those imposed on China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Still, the ruling against the chipmaker marks a further escalation in the tensions between the world’s two most powerful countries that have already ensnared other Chinese tech companies including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.“The restriction, once implemented, will severely damage SMIC’s existing and future manufacturing capabilities, and customer trust,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a note. “Without steady supply and service from the U.S., the yield and quality of SMIC’s capacity will degrade, as early as in a few months for more advanced nodes.”SMIC has not received an official notice of the sanctions, has no relationship with the Chinese armed forces and does not manufacture goods for any military end-users or uses, the Shanghai-based company said in an emailed statement over the weekend. The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing didn’t immediate respond Monday to a request for comment on the latest U.S. export restrictions.The SMIC ruling was a compromise between the Departments of Defense and Commerce and moderates in the Trump administration, according to one person familiar with the negotiations. The U.S. has reportedly said it was mulling a more severe blacklisting on SMIC -- akin to the ones imposed on Huawei -- that would affect exports from a broader set of companies.“If SMIC is not included in the Entity List, this could merely be confirmation of the rule change announced on April 27 for ‘civilian end-users’ in U.S.-unfriendly countries,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note. “Instead of a blanket ban, the U.S. will have sole discretion on what US companies can sell to SMIC.” The brokerage had previously estimated that as much as 50% of SMIC’s equipment is from the U.S.A formal statement that includes details of the restriction may be released by the U.S. Commerce Department Monday,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said. There will be a comment period of 30 days before the ruling takes effect, with semiconductor equipment companies and industry groups expected to push back against the restrictions, analysts including Atif Malik wrote in a note.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",0,0,
"By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON (Reuters) - More investors who typically make passive bets flexed their muscles last year and helped push a total of 922 companies to perform better by improving operations and capital allocation, data from research group Activist Insight show.The data show that 922 companies were approached last year compared with 856 companies approached in 2017 by investors who had ideas on how management could run the business better or who asked for board seats.So-called occasional activists were the most pushy last year, contacting 266 companies with public demands, the data show. In 2017 they reached out to 240 companies. These investors are typically passive shareholders who try to protect existing investments by demanding improvements at underperforming companies.The numbers also show that only 116 companies were contacted by primary focus activists, the large hedge funds that have made their reputations over the years by pushing for change at companies from Allergan (NYSE:AGN) to Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) ""More entrants into the activism space does limit the options for the big name activists,"" said Josh Black, an analyst at Activist Insight, which tracks activist fund managers and their activities.Activist Insight worked with law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel to compile its annual review.To be sure many primary focus activists like Starboard Value, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Third Point were busy in 2018 targeting companies ranging from Newell Brands to United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) to Campbell Soup. But as a group, primary focus activists targeted only 116 companies in 2018 after having reached out to 121 companies in 2017. This made them the least pushy last year, the data show.And the brand-name activists are still commanding attention from corporate chiefs. Elliott Management, one of the biggest firms to pursue activist strategies, was busier than ever in 2018 and launched 24 new campaigns. And Starboard won 29 seats through negotiated settlements in 2018.Referring to these types of firms who started 2019 on a busy note, Schulte Roth partner Eleazer Klein said pure play activists will always be around and working. ""These people are not going away.""And they will raise money even amid poor returns where the average activist hedge fund lost roughly 11 percent last year. ""Fund raising is certainly more challenging especially when firms are not performing. But I don't think these types of firms will have problems."" ",1,1,

"By Pete Schroeder and Imani MoiseWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday the Federal Reserve should not allow  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) to grow in size until the bank replaces Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan.In a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Warren said Sloan, a 30-year veteran of Wells, was ""deeply implicated"" in prior bank misconduct and it was untenable for him to remain at the bank as the Fed sought a drastic overhaul of its operations.""The Wells Fargo Board of Directors cannot plausibly claim that it is 'ensuring senior management's ongoing effectiveness in managing the firm's activities' while retaining a CEO that helped oversee this much misconduct,"" she wrote.The Fed took the unprecedented step of ordering the bank to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion in February, saying Wells Fargo had prioritized growth at the expense of proper compliance and risk management. The bank now must convince the Fed it has sufficiently overhauled its policies before it is permitted to grow.Warren has called for Sloan's removal in the past, but she cannot compel the U.S. central bank to take such a step. Still, her letter indicated she was ramping up her efforts to oust Sloan, and it marks the latest challenge for the bank in Washington, where Wells Fargo has been working to move past its scandals and rebuild its reputation.Wells Fargo is confident in the steps it has taken so far to satisfy the consent order and is engaged in constructive dialogue with the Fed, spokeswoman Erika Reynoso said in response to questions about the letter.A Fed spokesman said the agency had received the letter and would respond.Sloan told analysts during a conference call on Friday that the bank continues to expect the asset cap to be lifted in the first half of next year.Wells Fargo has been coping with a series of scandals since 2016, when it was reported that employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers’ names without their permission. The bank has disclosed other problems since then, including enrolling hundreds of thousands of customers in costly products, such as auto insurance, that they did not need or want.Since Sloan took over as CEO in 2016, analysts and investors have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn around the bank. Wells's board has defended its pick, saying Sloan's deep knowledge of the bank was an asset. Most recently, the bank's chair, Betsy Duke, shot down rumors that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former  Goldman Sachs Group  (N:GS) executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn. ""CEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered,"" she said in a statement at the time. Financial analysts do not expect Warren's letter to carry much weight with the Fed or with Wells Fargo's board, but the Fed has given in to Warren's pressure once before. In May, the Fed said it would hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on Wells Fargo, after being urged to do so by the Democratic senator. ""I don't think that political pressure is going to sway the Fed either way,"" said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders, noting that President Donald Trump's criticism of rising interest rates have not deterred the regulator from implementing more hikes.

"(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) said on Tuesday it would permanently suspend accounts that violate its policies while tweeting about QAnon, a fringe group that claims ""deep-state"" traitors are plotting against President Donald Trump. Twitter, which announced the change on its Twitter Safety page, said it would not serve content and accounts associated with QAnon in trends and recommendations, and would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform. The suspension, which will be rolled out this week, is expected to impact about 150,000 accounts globally, Twitter said. It said that more than 7,000 accounts have been removed in the last several weeks for violating the company's rules against spam, platform manipulation and ban evasion.The suspensions will be applied to accounts ""engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension — something we’ve seen more of in recent weeks,"" Twitter said. In online conspiracies, the term ""deep-state"" is used to refer to a combination of elites from the intelligence, political, business and entertainment fields, with QAnon's theories claiming that the ""deep-state"" is at a secret war with Trump.QAnon has also claimed that Democratic Party members are behind international crime rings. The group's content has spread widely on mainstream social media platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Earlier this year, Facebook removed a U.S. network of fake accounts linked to QAnon.

"By Joshua Franklin and David French(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) has held discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a deal that would allow it to debut in the stock market, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The discussions show that going public is solidly in the sights of SoFi's CEO, Anthony Noto. A former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) investment banker and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s ex-chief operating officer, Noto succeeded SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, who stepped down in 2018. Noto said last year that going public was in the company's long-term plans, but had cautioned it was not a priority.The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at $4.8 billion in a private fundraising round last year, has held talks with a number of so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), the sources said, cautioning there is no certainty an agreement would be reached. The sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. SoFi did not respond to requests for comment.A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds in an initial public offering with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger. SPACs have emerged as one of Wall Street's most popular investment vehicles in 2020, with 208 SPACs raising more than $70 billion so far this year, according to SPAC Research. United Wholesale Mortgage and Finance of America were among the mortgage lenders that agreed to go public this year through SPACs.Founded in 2011, SoFi capitalized on the retrenchment of banks from large swaths of consumer lending in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It started with refinancing student loans and expanded into mortgages and personal loans. The company said in October it had received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in its application for a national bank charter.

With slower growth and a Fed that is slow to cut, we think equities will struggle in the second half.”The reluctance to embrace stocks is echoing sentiment in a market where many see the momentum unlikely to continue given persistent uncertainties over corporate earnings and monetary policy. Hedge funds have largely sat out the rally, while professional forecasters see little room for gains in coming months. The median forecast from strategists points to 2,950 in December, slightly above the S&P 500’s current level of 2,931.Cecchini joined a growing list of prognosticators who have been forced to chase the rally. At least two other strategists have turned more bullish over the past month, including Tom Lee at Fundstrat and Credit Suisse’s Jonathan Golub.",0,0,

"(Bloomberg) -- Turmoil, meet month end. Month end, meet turmoil.The latest bout of risk-off moves in global markets has arrived just as investors prepare to close out the month and quarter. That leaves many with a conundrum: just how much of the current tumult is down to shifting fundamentals, and how much to portfolio rebalancing that usually accompanies the quarter end?The conclusion could be key to everything from the fate of the epic bull market in stocks and the chances of a bear market in bonds to the path charted by the greenback. It’s particularly important to short-term money market rates, which had been grinding higher as the U.S. raises benchmark borrowing costs and the era of easy money nears its end.“Markets have been volatile on alternating headlines and systematic flows in an illiquid trading environment,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists including Marko Kolanovic wrote in note. “While a number of narratives have come out to attempt to explain the recent market weakness, we believe these risks shouldn’t derail the larger positive fundamental forces.”Indeed, fewer players had the chance to exert larger-than-normal downward pressure as the holiday-shortened week sapped the market of its usual trading activity. Over the past eight years when U.S. stocks dropped more than 1 percent, volume on the U.S. tape has hit 8.6 billion trades on average. Tuesday’s session, however, fell about 1 billion short of that norm, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Still U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which had been locked above 2.8 percent for almost two months, finally fell below that threshold late in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Eurodollars advanced by five to seven basis points, while expectations for more Federal Reserve hikes faded.Month-end buying in fixed income did squeeze shorts into the close, according to Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed-income at NatAlliance Securities in New York. Yet that may not be the end of declines in bond yields.Considering everything from lower trending economic data to fading rate hike expectations, it’s likely 10-year yields “get an acceleration through to 2.65-ish” percent before getting to 3 percent, he wrote in a Tuesday note.One sign that rebalancing is at work: The yen was falling against the dollar on Wednesday, belying its usual status as a safe haven in times of trouble. For Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) AG, it’s a reason not to over-read the current moves.“These markets are all sound and fury,” he said in a tweet. “Simply looking for yesterday’s sell-off to continue today is as silly as expecting the Monday rally to continue yesterday.”Beyond the usual quarter-end portfolio tinkering, however, fundamental issues could still weigh on sentiment. Though growth remains strong, the peak in corporate earnings has passed -- and what remains in its place is an era of uneven global expansion, political uncertainty and a shift in market regime, according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.“As this unusually synchronized phase ends expect volatility and correlation to rise,” wrote the firm’s global quantitative strategy team, headed by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins. “This does not make us bearish, but reduces the upside from here.”Meanwhile in equities, Tuesday’s declines would appear to be about news rather than portfolio rebalancing. The S&P 500 Index was higher in the middle of the day before a steady stream of negative tech stories dragged some of the biggest companies lower. Even the Nasdaq 100 Index started Tuesday in the green; it ended the day with the biggest drop since February’s rout.U.S. stock futures, including contracts for the Nasdaq, turned positive on Wednesday as tech fears began to ease, while the yen slumped. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell, however, hovering around 2.77 percent.(Updates with Wednesday moves in last paragraph.)",1,1,
