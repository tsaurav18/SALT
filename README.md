We propose a novel method SALT: Sentiment Analysis for Long Text 

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a computational technique that involves the use of natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical methods to analyze and determine the emotional tone, attitudes, and opinions expressed in textual data. In an era dominated by vast amounts of user-generated content on social media, reviews, and other online platforms, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding and extracting valuable insights from the immense volume of textual information.
